  abstract = {Particles confined to a single file, in a narrow quasi-one-dimensional channel, exhibit a dynamic crossover from single file diffusion to Fickian diffusion as the channel radius increases and the particles begin to pass each other. The long time diffusion coefficient for a system in the crossover regime can be described in terms of a hopping time, which measures the time it takes for a particle to escape the cage formed by its neighbours. In this paper, we develop a transition state theory approach to the calculation of the hopping time, using the small system isobaric\textendash isothermal ensemble to rigorously account for the volume fluctuations associated with the size of the cage. We also describe a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that can be used to calculate the free energy barrier for particle hopping. The theory and simulation method correctly predict the hopping times for a two-dimensional confined ideal gas system and a system of confined hard discs over a range of channel radii, but the method breaks down for wide channels in the hard discs' case, underestimating the height of the hopping barrier due to the neglect of interactions between the small system and its surroundings.},

However, it has been found that it exhibits at large time sample to sample fluctuations characteristic of the KPZ universality class when observed in an atypical direction, i.e. along the ray \$x = v t\$ with \$v \textbackslash neq v\_0\$. Here we show, from exact solutions, that in the moderate deviation regime \$x - v\_0 t \textbackslash propto t\^\{3/4\}\$ these fluctuations are precisely described by the finite time KPZ equation, which thus describes the crossover between the Gaussian typical regime and the KPZ fixed point regime for the large deviations. This confirms heuristic arguments given in [2]. These exact results include the discrete model known as the Beta RWRE, and a continuum diffusion. They predict the behavior of the maximum of a large number of independent walkers, which should be easier to observe (e.g. in experiments) in this moderate deviations regime.},

  abstract = {Non-Fickian (or anomalous) transport of contaminants has been observed at field and laboratory scales in a wide variety of porous and fractured geological formations. Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.

A Brief Introduction The main theme of this series of lectures are "Random motions in random me\- dia". The subject gathers a variety of probabilistic models often originated from physical sciences such as solid state physics, physical chemistry, oceanography, biophysics . . . , in which typically some diffusion mechanism takes place in an inho\- mogeneous medium. Randomness appears at two levels. It comes in the description of the motion of the particle diffusing in the medium, this is a rather traditional point of view for probability theory; but it also comes in the very description of the medium in which the diffusion takes place.},

The "Ariadne's clew" we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate "anomalous" (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder.

We provide both a clear physical picture of the process and a variety of analytical techniques. As the average bias {$\mu$} is increased, a succession of different ``diffusion laws'' is observed: Sinai's diffusion ({$\mu$} = 0, x2 {$\backsimeq$} ln4t), anomalous drift (x {$\backsimeq$} t{$\mu$}, {$\mu$} {$<$} 1), anomalous dispersion (x - Vt {$\backsimeq$} {$\pm$}t1{$\mu$}, 1 {$<$} {$\mu$} {$<$} 2), and finally normal diffusion ({$\mu$} {$>$} 2), apart from algebraic tails outside the scaling region. We show that all those results can be understood in simple terms through a large scale description of the problem as a directed walk among traps characterized by a broad distribution of release time. From this analysis, the full asymptotic probability distributions (averaged over disorder) are precisely determined, in terms of L\'evy stable laws. Sample to sample fluctuations are discussed. The probability of presence at the initial point is more specifically adressed. It amounts to computing the density of states of a Schr\"odinger equation with a special type of random potential. We obtain exactly the average over disorder of this quantity, using the following two different approaches: the ``Dyson-Schmidt'' technique, and the replica method. Both reveal interesting technical features, and the latter can be used to obtain information on the full probability distribution (and Green function). Some physical applications of this model are discussed.},

At zero energy {$\rho$}({$\epsilon$}) exhibits a variety of singular behaviours with a continuously varying exponent. This corresponds to the different phases of the diffusion problem at large time, including Sina\"i's behaviour {$\langle$}x2(t){$\rangle$} = C ln4t.

This class is called the Kardar\textendash Parisi\textendash Zhang (KPZ) universality class and underlying it is, again, a continuum object \textemdash{} a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation \textemdash{} known as the KPZ equation. The purpose of this survey is to explain the context for, as well as the content of a number of mathematical breakthroughs which have culminated in the derivation of the exact formula for the distribution function of the KPZ equation started with narrow wedge initial data. In particular we emphasize three topics: (1) The approximation of the KPZ equation through the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process; (2) The derivation of the exact one-point distribution of the solution to the KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial data; (3) Connections with directed polymers in random media. As the purpose of this article is to survey and review, we make precise statements but provide only heuristic arguments with indications of the technical complexities necessary to make such arguments mathematically rigorous.},

  abstract = {The nonequilibrium dynamics of classical random Ising spin chains with nonconserved magnetization are studied using an asymptotically exact real space renormalization group (RSRG). We focus on random field Ising model (RFIM) spin chains with and without a uniform applied field, as well as on Ising spin glass chains in an applied field. For the RFIM we consider a universal regime where the random field and the temperature are both much smaller than the exchange coupling. In this regime, the Imry-Ma length that sets the scale of the equilibrium correlations is large and the coarsening of domains from random initial conditions (e.g., a quench from high temperature) occurs over a wide range of length scales. The two types of domain walls that occur diffuse in opposite random potentials, of the form studied by Sinai, and domain walls annihilate when they meet. Using the RSRG we compute many universal asymptotic properties of both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium limit. We find that the configurations of the domain walls converge rapidly toward a set of system-specific time-dependent positions that are independent of the initial conditions. Thus the behavior of this nonequilibrium system is pseudodeterministic at long times because of the broad distributions of barriers that occur on the long length scales involved. Specifically, we obtain the time dependence of the energy, the magnetization, and the distribution of domain sizes (found to be statistically independent). The equilibrium limits agree with known exact results. We obtain the exact scaling form of the two-point equal time correlation function \textasciimacron{$\langle$}S0(t)Sx(t){$\rangle$} and the two-time autocorrelations \textasciimacron{$\langle$}S0(t{${'}$})S0(t){$\rangle$}. We also compute the persistence properties of a single spin, of local magnetization, and of domains. The analogous quantities for the {$\pm$}J Ising spin glass in an applied field are obtained from the RFIM via a gauge transformation. In addition to these we compute the two-point two-time correlation function \textasciimacron{$\langle$}S0(t)Sx(t){$\rangle\langle$}S0(t{${'}$})Sx(t{${'}$}){$\rangle$} which can in principle be measured by experiments on spin-glass-like systems. The thermal fluctuations are studied and found to be dominated by rare events; in particular all moments of truncated equal time correlations are computed. Physical properties which are typically measured in aging experiments are also studied, focusing on the response to a small magnetic field which is applied after waiting for the system to equilibrate for a time tw. The nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t,tw) is computed. We find that for (t-tw){$\sim$}t\^{$\alpha$}w with \^{$\alpha<$}1, the ratio equal to its equilibrium value X=1, although time translational invariance does not hold in this regime. For t-tw{$\sim$}tw the ratio exhibits an aging regime with a nontrivial X=X(t/tw){$\neq$}1, but the behavior is markedly different from mean field theory. Finally the distribution of the total magnetization and of the number of domains is computed for large finite size systems. General issues about convergence toward equilibrium and the possibilities of weakly history-dependent evolution in other random systems are discussed.},

In particular, we analyse how the strength of the tracer-obstacle interactions and the volume occupancy of the crowders alter the diffusive motion of the tracer. From the details of partitioning of the tracer diffusion modes between trapping states when bound to obstacles and bulk diffusion, we examine the degree of localisation of the tracer in the lattice of crowders. We study the properties of the tracer diffusion in terms of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements, the trapping time distributions, the amplitude variation of the time averaged mean squared displacements, and the non-Gaussianity parameter of the diffusing tracer. We conclude that tracer-obstacle adsorption and binding triggers a transient anomalous diffusion. From a very narrow spread of recorded individual time averaged trajectories we exclude continuous type random walk processes as the underlying physical model of the tracer diffusion in our system. For moderate tracer-crowder attraction the motion is found to be fully ergodic, while at stronger attraction strength a transient disparity between ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements occurs. We also put our results into perspective with findings from experimental single-particle tracking and simulations of the diffusion of tagged tracers in dense crowded suspensions. Our results have implications for the diffusion, transport, and spreading of chemical components in highly crowded environments inside living cells and other structured liquids.},

Here we push the understanding of first passage processes one step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.},

Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L\'evy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling. \textcopyright 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed. As a closely related technique, we investigate the concept of damage spreading. It is shown that this technique is ambiguous to some extent, making it impossible to define chaotic and regular phases in stochastic non-equilibrium systems.

  abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that the diffusive motion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarizing their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a sublinear, power-law increase of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations in time, non-Gaussian distributions of spatial displacements, heterogeneous diffusion and a fraction of immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarize some widely used theoretical models: Gaussian models like fractional Brownian motion and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the continuous-time random walk model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Particular emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of two-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even if the MSDs are identical. Then, we review the theory underlying commonly applied experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport like single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where a variety of model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations are discussed which play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future investigation. \textcopyright{} 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Since the governing variable itself typically undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time is called the "first passage" time and the corresponding process is a "first passage" (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques; the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.},

  abstract = {Brownian motion is widely used as a model of diffusion in equilibrium media throughout the physical, chemical and biological sciences. However, many real-world systems are intrinsically out of equilibrium owing to energy-dissipating active processes underlying their mechanical and dynamical features1. The diffusion process followed by a passive tracer in prototypical active media, such as suspensions of active colloids or swimming microorganisms2, differs considerably from Brownian motion, as revealed by a greatly enhanced diffusion coefficient3-10 and non-Gaussian statistics of the tracer displacements6,9,10. Although these characteristic features have been extensively observed experimentally, there is so far no comprehensive theory explaining how they emerge from the microscopic dynamics of the system. Here we develop a theoretical framework to model the hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer and the active swimmers, which shows that the tracer follows a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process that accounts for all empirical observations. The theory predicts a long-lived L\'evy flight regime11 of the loopy~tracer motion with a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The duration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, suggesting that the optimal foraging strategy of swimming microorganisms might depend crucially on their density in order to exploit the L\'evy flights of nutrients12. Our framework can be applied to address important theoretical questions, such as the thermodynamics of active systems13, and practical ones, such as the interaction of swimming microorganisms with nutrients and other small particles14 (for example, degraded plastic) and the design of artificial nanoscale machines15.},

Engineering simulation, which employs computational fluid dynamics, provides a convenient means of investigating airflow behaviour in isolation rooms for various ventilation arrangements.

An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of virus diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was also performed for each ventilation arrangement. The numerical results presented in this paper indicate that the parallel-directional airflow pattern is the most effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. Additionally, staggering the positions of the supply vents at the door end of the room relative to the exhaust vents on the wall behind the bed head provides effective infection control and containment. These results suggest that this particular ventilation arrangement enhances the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.},

The crossover is described by a non-linear system which interpolates between the derivative and the standard non-linear Schrodinger equations in imaginary time. We solve this system using the inverse scattering method for mixed-time boundary conditions introduced by us to solve the WNT. We obtain the rate function which describes the large deviations of the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the cumulative distribution of the tracer position. It exhibits a crossover as the asymmetry is varied, recovering both MFT and KPZ limits. We sketch how it is consistent with extracting the asymptotics of a Fredholm determinant formula, recently derived for sticky Brownian motions. The crossover mechanism studied here should generalize to a larger class of models described by the MFT. Our results apply to study extremal diffusion beyond Einstein's theory.},

Here, we investigate the effect of these dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneities onto diffusion-limited reactions. We describe a general mathematical framework to translate many results for ordinary homogeneous Brownian motion to heterogeneous diffusion. In particular, we derive the probability density of the first-passage time to a reaction event and show how the dynamic disorder broadens the distribution and increases the likelihood of both short and long trajectories to reactive targets. While the disorder slows down reaction kinetics on average, its dynamic character is beneficial for a faster search and realization of an individual reaction event triggered by a single molecule.},

  abstract = {Sinai's model of diffusion in one dimension with random local bias is studied by a real space renormalization group, which yields exact results at long times. The effects of an additional small uniform bias force are also studied. We obtain analytically the scaling form of the distribution of the position x(t) of a particle, the probability of it not returning to the origin, and the distributions of first passage times, in an infinite sample as well as in the presence of a boundary and in a finite but large sample. We compute the distribution of the meeting time of two particles in the same environment. We also obtain a detailed analytic description of the thermally averaged trajectories by computing quantities such as the joint distribution of the number of returns and of the number of jumps forward. These quantities obey multifractal scaling, characterized by generalized persistence exponents \texttheta (g) which we compute. In the presence of a small bias, the number of returns to the origin becomes finite, characterized by a universal scaling function which we obtain. The full statistics of the distribution of successive times of return of thermally averaged trajectories is obtained, as well as detailed analytical information about correlations between directions and times of successive jumps. The two-time distribution of the positions of a particle, x(t) and x(t{${'}$}) with t{$>$}t{${'}$}, is also computed exactly. It is found to exhibit ``aging'' with several time regimes characterized by different behaviors. In the unbiased case, for t-t{${'}\sim$}t'{$\alpha$} with {$\alpha>$}1, it exhibits a lnt/lnt{${'}$} scaling, with a singularity at coinciding rescaled positions x(t)=x(t{${'}$}). This singularity is a novel feature, and corresponds to particles that remain in a renormalized valley. For closer times {$\alpha<$}1, the two-time diffusion front exhibits a quasiequilibrium regime with a ln(t-t{${'}$})/lnt{${'}$} behavior which we compute. The crossover to a t/t{${'}$} aging form in the presence of a small bias is also obtained analytically. Rare events corresponding to intermittent splitting of the thermal packet between separated wells which dominate some averaged observables are also characterized in detail. Connections with the Green function of a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger problem and quantum spin chains are discussed.},

We obtain exact formulae for its velocity V L and diffusion constant D L for arbitrary periodic f(x) of period L. They involve the "active potential"which allows to define a global bias. Upon varying parameters, such as an external force F, the dynamics undergoes transitions from non-ergodic trapped states, to various moving states, some with non-analyticities in the V L vs. F curve. A random landscape in the presence of a bias leads, for large L, to anomalous diffusion x {$\sim$} t{$\mu$}, {$\mu$} {$<$} 1, or to a phase with a finite velocity that we calculate.},

  abstract = {Optical microscopy has for centuries been a key tool to study living cells with minimum invasiveness. The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems. Amongst these techniques, single particle tracking (SPT) has emerged as a powerful approach to study a variety of dynamic processes in life sciences. SPT provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of SPT together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of SPT trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function. The last part of the review concentrates on different theoretical models that describe anomalous transport behavior and ergodicity breaking observed from SPT studies in living cells.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of constituents and the surface response of cellular membranes-also in connection to the binding of various particles and macromolecules to the membrane-are still a matter of controversy in the membrane biophysics community, particularly with respect to crowded membranes of living biological cells. We here put into perspective recent single particle tracking experiments in the plasma membranes of living cells and supercomputing studies of lipid bilayer model membranes with and without protein crowding. Special emphasis is put on the observation of anomalous, non-Brownian diffusion of both lipid molecules and proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. While single component, pure lipid bilayers in simulations exhibit only transient anomalous diffusion of lipid molecules on nanosecond time scales, the persistence of anomalous diffusion becomes significantly longer ranged on the addition of disorder-through the addition of cholesterol or proteins-and on passing of the membrane lipids to the gel phase. Concurrently, experiments demonstrate the anomalous diffusion of membrane embedded proteins up to macroscopic time scales in the minute time range. Particular emphasis will be put on the physical character of the anomalous diffusion, in particular, the occurrence of ageing observed in the experiments-the effective diffusivity of the measured particles is a decreasing function of time. Moreover, we present results for the time dependent local scaling exponent of the mean squared displacement of the monitored particles. Recent results finding deviations from the commonly assumed Gaussian diffusion patterns in protein crowded membranes are reported. The properties of the displacement autocorrelation function of the lipid molecules are discussed in the light of their appropriate physical anomalous diffusion models, both for non-crowded and crowded membranes. In the last part of this review we address the upcoming field of membrane distortion by elongated membrane-binding particles. We discuss how membrane compartmentalisation and the particle-membrane binding energy may impact the dynamics and response of lipid membranes.

  abstract = {Diffusion plays a crucial role in brain function. The spaces between cells can be likened to the water phase of a foam and many substances move within this complicated region. Diffusion in this interstitial space can be accurately modelled with appropriate modifications of classical equations and quantified from measurements based on novel micro-techniques. Besides delivering glucose and oxygen from the vascular system to brain cells, diffusion also moves informational substances between cells, a process known as volume transmission. Deviations from expected results reveal how local uptake, degradation or bulk flow may modify the transport of molecules. Diffusion is also essential to many therapies that deliver drugs to the brain. The diffusion-generated concentration distributions of well-chosen molecules also reveal the structure of brain tissue. This structure is represented by the volume fraction (void space) and the tortuosity (hindrance to diffusion imposed by local boundaries or local viscosity). Analysis of these parameters also reveals how the local geometry of the brain changes with time or under pathological conditions. Theoretical and experimental approaches borrow from classical diffusion theory and from porous media concepts. Earlier studies were based on radiotracers but the recent methods use a point-source paradigm coupled with micro-sensors or optical imaging of macromolecules labelled with fluorescent tags. These concepts and methods are likely to be applicable elsewhere to measure diffusion properties in very small volumes of highly structured but delicate material.},

At pressures for which the mean free path {$\lambda\gg$}a, the result in the limit L\textrightarrow{$\infty$} reduces to that already obtained by M. Knudsen, the diffusion coefficient D being given by 2a\textasciimacron v3, where \textasciimacron v is the mean molecular speed. For a capillary of finite length the diffusion coefficient is, to first order in aL, smaller than this by a factor 1-3a4L. In the opposite limit of high pressures, for which {$\lambda\ll$}a, the result reduces to the elementary kinetic theory expression for the self diffusion coefficient, D={$\lambda$}\textasciimacron v3. One of the most significant features of the result is that in a long tube the diffusion coefficient drops very rapidly with increasing pressure from its initial value for {$\lambda\gg$}L. Thus the initial slope of D as a function of pressure is given by dDd(a{$\lambda$}){$\cong-$}12\textasciimacron va lnLa. It is shown that these results account for the anomalous low pressure minima observed by several investigators who have measured the specific flow G{$\Delta$}p through long capillary tubes as a function of mean pressure \textasciimacron p. The failure to observe such minima with porous media, for which effectively L{$\approx$}a in each pore, is also explained by these results. The formulae obtained here represent a rigorous solution to the long capillary diffusion problem, valid at all pressures and subject only to the limitations of the mean free path type of treatment.},

  abstract = {How do we know that molecules really exist? An important clue came from Brownian movement, a concept developed in 1827 by botanist Robert Brown, who noticed that tiny objects like pollen grains shook and moved erratically when viewed under a microscope. Nearly 80 years later, in 1905, Albert Einstein explained this "Brownian motion" as the result of bombardment by molecules. Einstein offered a quantitative explanation by mathematically estimating the average distance covered by the particles over time as a result of molecular bombardment. Four years later, Jean Baptiste Perrin wrote Brownian Movement and Molecular Reality, a work that explains his painstaking measurements of the displacements of particles of a resin suspended in water-experiments that yielded average displacements in excellent accord with Einstein's theoretical prediction.The studies of Einstein and Perrin provided some of the first concrete evidence for the existence of molecules. Perrin, whose name is familiar to all who employ his methods for calculations in molecular dynamics, received the 1926 Nobel Prize in physics. In this classic paper, he introduced the concept of Avogadro's number, along with other groundbreaking work. Originally published in the French journal Annates de chimie et de physique, it was translated into English by Frederick Soddy to enduring influence and acclaim.},

We show that the distribution of k-step walks from b vertices chosen uniformly at random can be approximated up to error {$\smallin$} per walk using  words of space with a single pass over a randomly ordered stream of edges, solving an open problem of Peng and Sohler [SODA '18]. Applications of our result include the estimation of the average return probability of the k-step walk (the trace of the kth power of the random walk matrix) as well as the estimation of PageRank. We complement our algorithm with a strong impossibility result for directed graphs.}

  abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is {$\sim$}20\% and the tortuosity is {$\sim$}1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

  abstract = {Scaling level-spacing distribution functions in the ``bulk of the spectrum'' in random matrix models of N \texttimes{} N hermitian matrices and then going to the limit N \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}, leads to the Fredholm determinant of the sine kernel sin {$\pi$} (x - y)/{$\pi$}(x - y). Similarly a double scaling limit at the ``edge of the spectrum'' leads to the Airy kernel [Ai(x)Ai{${'}$}(y) - Ai{${'}$}(x)Ai(y)]/(x-y). We announce analogies for this Airy kernel of the following properties of the sine kernel: the completely integrable system of PDE's found by Jimbo, Miwa, M\^ori and Sato; the expression, in the case of a single interval, of the Fredholm determinant in terms of a Painlev\'e transcendent; the existence of a commuting differential operator; and the fact that this operator can be used in the derivation of asymptotics, for general n, of the probability that an interval contains precisely n eigenvalues.},

  abstract = {With a method first indicated by Ornstein the mean values of all the powers of the velocity u and the displacement s of a free particle in Brownian motion are calculated. It is shown that u-u0exp(-{$\beta$}t) and s-u0{$\beta$}[1-exp(-{$\beta$}t)] where u0 is the initial velocity and {$\beta$} the friction coefficient divided by the mass of the particle, follow the normal Gaussian distribution law. For s this gives the exact frequency distribution corresponding to the exact formula for s2 of Ornstein and F\"urth. Discussion is given of the connection with the Fokker-Planck partial differential equation. By the same method exact expressions are obtained for the square of the deviation of a harmonically bound particle in Brownian motion as a function of the time and the initial deviation. Here the periodic, aperiodic and overdamped cases have to be treated separately. In the last case, when {$\beta$} is much larger than the frequency and for values of t{$\gg\beta-$}1, the formula takes the form of that previously given by Smoluchowski.},

  abstract = {This work is a self-contained introduction to some basic aspects of the dynamics that occurs in biological populations. It focusses on the proportion (or frequency) of a population that carries a particular gene. We make use of the notion of a force, in the context of genetics and evolution, to describe the dynamics of the frequency in an effectively infinite population. We then show how randomness enters into the dynamics of populations with a finite size, a randomness known as random genetic drift. We derive an equation, involving random numbers, which describes how the frequency behaves in a population of finite size. It is shown that in some situations this equation exhibits irreversible absorption phenomena. These phenomena are associated with the extinction (or loss) of the gene, or the complete takeover by the gene (termed fixation), where 100\% of the population carries the gene. Taking the theory further, we show how an approximation leads to a stochastic differential equation for the frequency, where random genetic drift takes the form of an additional contribution to the force, that randomly fluctuates. The stochastic differential equation is, in turn, related to a diffusion equation, which encompasses many fundamental phenomena. Because of this, the diffusion equation plausibly has a similar status in biology to the Schr\"odinger equation in physics. It is notable that both the Schr\"odinger equation and the diffusion equation have a somewhat similar mathematical structure: they both involve first order derivatives of time and second order derivatives of space (or the analogue of space). There are, however, some significant mathematical differences. In contrast to the Schr\"odinger equation, the diffusion equation can routinely have solutions which are singular, in that the solutions contain Dirac delta functions. The delta functions are not, however, problematic, and have an explicit biological significance. We illustrate results with some basic calculations and computer simulations.},

The results indicate that the SE relation holds at intermediate frequencies that correspond to the {$\beta$}-relaxation and the onset of the {$\alpha$}-relaxation regimes. Large deviations, which increase as the temperature decreases, are observed at frequencies well below the frequency at which the non-Gaussian parameter {$\alpha$}2 is maximum. We argue that the breakdown of the SE relation in supercooled liquids arises from underestimation of the diffusion coefficient due to neglect of correlated motions.},

  abstract = {The position x(t) of a particle diffusing in a one-dimensional uncorrelated and time dependent random medium is simply Gaussian distributed in the typical direction, i.e. along the ray x = v 0 t, where v 0 is the average drift. However, it has been found that it exhibits at large time sample to sample fluctuations characteristic of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class when observed in an atypical direction, i.e. along the ray x = vt with v = v 0. Here we show, from exact solutions, that in the moderate deviation regime x - v 0 t {$\propto$} t 3/4 these fluctuations are precisely described by the finite time KPZ equation, which thus describes the crossover between the Gaussian typical regime and the KPZ fixed point regime for the large deviations. This confirms heuristic arguments given in [2]. These exact results include the discrete model known as the Beta random walk in a time dependent random environment, and a continuum diffusion. They predict the behavior of the maximum of a large number of independent walkers , which should be easier to observe (e.g. in experiments) in this moderate deviations regime.
