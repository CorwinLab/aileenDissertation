Gratitude for my husband, Ben. For my little research assistant Eleanor, who joined me in 2021. She makes it all worth it. 

For my family, especially my dad, because I wouldn't have chosen to pursue science without his encouragement. ``Remember to enjoy what you are doing. If life seems difficult, remember what makes you happy.''

For everyone who watched Ellie so I could fit in another hour or two of work. For Erica, her bonus aunt. For Heather, Sky, and the other teachers and staff at the Co-op Family Center who loved my girl and helped her grow.

Appreciation for everyone who got me coffee/a treat or told me about the free food in such-and-such building. For my labmates: Jacob Hass, Eddie Bautista, Viola Bolton-Lum, and Franscesca Ark. For my advisor Eric Corwin, Raghuveer Parthasarathy and the laser I stole from his lab for these few years, and Markus Allgaier for helping me far more than some random postdoc in another lab ever should have.
