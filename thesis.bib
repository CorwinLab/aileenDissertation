	abstract = {First-passage properties underlie a wide range of stochastic processes, such as diffusion-limited growth, neuron firing and the triggering of stock options. This book provides a unified presentation of first-passage processes, which highlights its interrelations with electrostatics and the resulting powerful consequences. The author begins with a presentation of fundamental theory including the connection between the occupation and first-passage probabilities of a random walk, and the connection to electrostatics and current flows in resistor networks. The consequences of this theory are then developed for simple, illustrative geometries including the finite and semi-infinite intervals, fractal networks, spherical geometries and the wedge. Various applications are presented including neuron dynamics, self-organized criticality, diffusion-limited aggregation, the dynamics of spin systems and the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions. First-passage processes provide an appealing way for graduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry, theoretical biology, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, operations research and finance to understand all of these systems.},

How fast this step is accomplished sets the "speed limit" for the larger-scale processes it enables, whether the process is antibody production by the immune system or tissue differentiation in a developing embryo. This naturally leads us to ask, How long does it take for DNA segments that are strung out over millions of base pairs along the chromatin fiber to find each other in the crowded cell? This question, fundamental to biology, can be recognized as the physics problem of the first-passage time, or the waiting time for the first encounter. Here, we review a number of approaches to revealing the physical principles by which cells solve, with astonishing efficiency, the first-passage problem for remote genomic interactions.},

This study explores the intraday price time series of Taiwan futures, and applies diffusion model and quantitative methods to analyze the relationship between the anchoring effect and price fluctuations during first passage process. Our results indicate that power-law scaling and anomalous diffusion for stock price fluctuations are related to the anchoring effect. Moreover, microscopic price fluctuations before switching point in first passage process correspond with long-term price fluctuations of Taiwan’s stock market. We find that microscopic trends could provide useful information for understanding macroscopic trends in stock markets.},

Partial differential equations describing the relations between input and output variables have been replaced with simpler ordinary differential equations by using mathematical approximations of the hyperbolic functions in the Laplace transform domain. The model is composed of two submodels. In the first, oxygen transport from capillary blood to cerebral tissue is analyzed to link changes in mean tissue oxygen pressure with CBF and arterial oxygen concentration changes. The second submodel contains equations describing the production of vasoactive metabolites by cerebral parenchyma, due to a lack of oxygen and their diffusion towards pial perivascular space. The equations have been used to simulate the time dynamics of mean tissue P/sub O2/, perivascular adenosine concentration, and perivascular pH following changes in CBF. The simulation shows that the time delay introduced by diffusion processes is negligible compared with the other time constants of the system under study.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Diffusion of solutes is often encountered in many biological processes. In the blood micro circulation system, solutes, such as oxygen and calcium molecules, as well as Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) and biochemical messengers, are released by cells (like red blood and endothelial cells), and are dispersed via diffusion and advection. Moreover, several targeted drug delivery strategies rely on an encapsulation of chemicals and on their release in the blood stream at specific location. The released chemicals couple to blood flow, in which red blood cells (RBCs) constitute the major component. Thus, the development of numerical methods which take into account both dynamics of RBCs and their coupling with chemicals is of great importance for many biomedical applications. We develop here a lattice-Boltzmann based method that deals with generic moving boundary conditions in an advection-diffusion field representing the chemicals. The boundary condition of the solutes at the cell membrane is based on a modified bounce-back scheme. We prove analytically, and validate numerically, that it enjoys second order precision. The solver is validated with several benchmarks and is then coupled with a solver for a suspension of RBCs, we developed previously. We then exemplify the method on the problem of liposome drug delivery in arterioles. The results show that for a rigid drug carrier at a scale of about 1 μm, the presence of RBCs facilitates the drug absorption along the vessel wall. We also exemplify the solver for the release of chemicals induced by membrane shear stress, a feature which is omnipresent in mechano-involved signaling processes. As a way of example, we briefly study the problem of ATP release by RBCs. We point out several possible generalizations.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility and added value of single breathhold diffusion-weighted (DW) imaging (DWI) in oncology patients undergoing abdominal MRI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 169 patients with malignancy underwent abdominal MRI at 1.5T, including T1-weighted (T1W), T2-weighted (T2W), and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Axial DWI was performed with a single-shot spin-echo (SE) echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence using a b-value of 500 seconds/mm2. A total of 24 slices were obtained during a 20-second breathhold. Two observers reviewed the conventional MR images for tumor. Next, the DW images were reviewed for additional tumor not depicted on conventional MR images
RESULTS: For the 169 patients, additional tumors were noted on the DW images in 77 (0.46) for observer 1 and 67 (0.40) for observer 2. For observer 1 the additional tumor included lymphadenopathy (47), peritoneal metastases (15), renal (1), liver (12), and osseous (2), while for observer 2 the corresponding values were lymphadenopathy (40), peritoneal (12), renal (1), liver (6), osseous (4), and gastrointestinal (1). The DW images resolved as benign findings noted on the conventional MR images in three patients for observer 1 and four patients for observer 2. The conventional MR exam was entirely normal while the DW images showed tumor in 12 (0.07) patients for observer 1 and 10 (0.06) patients for observer 2.
CONCLUSION: DWI is feasible in a single breathhold and provides additional clinically important information in oncology patients when added to routine abdominal MR sequences.},

The authors have developed a magnetic resonance (MR) method to image such intravoxel incoherent motions (IVIMs) by using appropriate gradient pulses. Images were generated at 0.5 T in a high-resolution, multisection mode. Diffusion coefficients measured on images of water and acetone phantoms were consistent with published values. Images obtained in the neurologic area from healthy subjects and patients were analyzed in terms of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) incorporating the effect of all IVIMs. Differences were found between various normal and pathologic tissues. The ADC of in vivo water differed from the diffusion coefficient of pure water. Results were assessed in relation to water compartmentation in biologic tissues (restricted diffusion) and tissue perfusion. Nonuniform slow flow of cerebrospinal fluid appeared as a useful feature on IVIM images. Observation of these motions may significantly extend the diagnostic capabilities of MR imaging.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Outcome prediction is challenging in comatose postcardiac arrest survivors. We assessed the feasibility and prognostic utility of brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) during the first week.
METHODS: Consecutive comatose postcardiac arrest patients were prospectively enrolled. AWI data of patients who met predefined specific prognostic criteria were used to determine distinguishing apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) thresholds. Group 1 criteria were death at 6 months and absent motor response or absent pupillary reflexes or bilateral absent cortical responses at 72 hours or vegetative at 1 month. Group 2 criterion was survival at 6 months with a Glasgow Outcome Scale score of 4 or 5 (group 2A) or 3 (group 2B). The percentage of voxels below different ADC thresholds was calculated at 50 x 10(-6) mm(2)/sec intervals.
RESULTS: Overall, 86\% of patients underwent DWI. Fifty-one patients with 62 brain DWIs were included. Forty patients met the specific prognostic criteria. The percentage of brain volume with an ADC value less than 650 to 700 x 10(-6)mm(2)/sec best differentiated between Group 1 and Groups 2A and 2B combined (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas the 400 to 450 x 10(-6)mm(2)/sec threshold best differentiated between Groups 2A and 2B (p = 0.003). The ideal time window for prognostication using DWI was between 49 and 108 hours after the arrest. When comparing DWI in this time window with the 72-hour neurological examination, DWI improved the sensitivity for predicting poor outcome by 38\% while maintaining 100\% specificity (p = 0.021).
INTERPRETATION: Quantitative DWI in comatose postcardiac arrest survivors holds promise as a prognostic adjunct.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to investigate the feasibility of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in evaluating normal fetal brain development from gestational week 24 up to term age.
METHODS: Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) was performed on 40 normal fetuses (with normal results on sonography and normal fetal MRI results), with two b-values of 0 and 600 s/mm² in the three (x, y, z) orthogonal axes. Ten regions of interest (ROIs) were manually placed symmetrically in the bilateral frontal white matter (FWM), occipital white matter (OWM), thalamus (THAL), basal ganglia (BG), and cerebellar hemispheres (CH). ADC values of the ten ROIs in all subjects were measured by two radiologists independently. One-way ANOVA was used to calculate the differences among the five regions in the fetal brain and linear regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between ADC values and gestational age (GA). p {\textless} 0.05 was considered significantly different.
RESULTS: Mean GA was 31.3 ± 3.9 (range 24-41) weeks. The overall mean ADC values (× 10⁻⁶ mm²/s) of the fetuses were 1,800 ± 214 (FWM), 1,400 ± 100 (BG), 1,300 ± 126 (THAL), 1,700 ± 133 (OWM) and 1,400 ± 155 (CH), respectively. The ADC value of BG was not significantly different from those of THAL and CH, while the other four ROIs had significant differences with each other. The ADC values of BG, THAL, OWM and CH had strong negative correlations with increasing GA (R were -0.568, -0.716, -0.830 and -0.700, respectively, all p {\textless} 0.01), OWM declined fastest with GA, followed by CH and THAL, the slowest being BG. The ADC value of FWM had no significant change with GA (p = 0.366).

        This study aimed to assess apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of the placenta and fetal organs in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
        Materials and methods 
        A prospective study of 30 consecutive pregnant women (aged 21–38 years with mean age of 31.5 years and a mean gestational week of 35 ± 2.3) with IUGR and 15 age-matched pregnant women was conducted. All patients and controls underwent diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The ADCs of the placenta and fetal brain, kidney, and lung were calculated and correlated with neonates needing intensive care unit (ICU) admission.
        Results 
        There was a significant difference in ADC of the placenta and fetal brain, lung, and kidney (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.04, and 0.04, respectively) between the patients and the controls. The cutoff ADCs of the placenta and fetal brain, lung, and kidney used to detect IUGR were 1.45, 1.15, 1.80, and 1.40 × 10−3 mm2/s, respectively, with areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.865, 0.858, 0.812, and 0.650, respectively, and accuracy values of 75\%, 72.5\%, 72.5\%, and 70\%, respectively. Combined ADC of the placenta and fetal organs used to detect IUGR revealed an AUC of 1.00 and an accuracy of 100\%. There was a significant difference in ADC of the placenta and fetal brain, lung, and kidney between neonates needing admission and those not needing ICU admission (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.002, and 0.002, respectively). The cutoff ADCs of the placenta and fetal brain, lung, and kidney used to define neonates needing ICU were 1.35, 1.25, 1.95, and 1.15 × 10−3 mm2/s with AUCs of 0.955, 0.880, 0.884, and 0.793, respectively, and accuracy values of 86.7\%, 46.7\%, 76.7\%, and 70\%, respectively. Combined placental and fetal brain ADC used to define neonates needing ICU revealed an AUC of 0.968 and an accuracy of 93.3\%.

	abstract = {A thermal colloid suspended in a liquid will transition from a short-time ballistic motion to a long-time diffusive motion. However, the transition between ballistic and diffusive motion is highly dependent on the properties and structure of the particular liquid. We directly observe a free floating tracer particle's ballistic motion and its transition to the long-time regime in both a Newtonian fluid and a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid. We examine the motion of the free particle in a Newtonian fluid and demonstrate a high degree of agreement with the accepted Clercx-Schram model for motion in a dense fluid. Measurements of the functional form of the ballistic-to-diffusive transition provide direct measurements of the temperature, viscosity, and tracer radius. We likewise measure the motion in a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid and find a significant disagreement between the theoretical asymptotic behavior and our measured values of the microscopic properties of the fluid. We observe a greatly increased effective mass for a freely moving particle and a decreased plateau modulus.},

Using a Fredholm determinant representation for the quenched probability distribution function of the walker’s position, we are able to prove second order cube-root scale corrections to the large deviation principle satisfied by the walker’s position, with convergence to the Tracy–Widom distribution. We also show that this limit theorem can be interpreted in terms of the maximum of strongly correlated random variables: the positions of independent walkers in the same environment. The zero-temperature counterpart of the Beta RWRE can be studied in a parallel way. We also prove a Tracy–Widom limit theorem for this model.},

On the other hand, spectroscopic techniques such as fluorescence resonance energy transfer cannot be used to measure distances {\textgreater}10 nm, leaving a “gap” in the ability of optical techniques to measure distances on the 10- to 100-nm scale. We have previously demonstrated the ability to localize single dye molecules to a precision of 1.5 nm with subsecond time resolution. Here we locate the position of two dyes and determine their separation with 5-nm precision, using the quantal photobleaching behavior of single fluorescent dye molecules. By fitting images both before and after photobleaching of one of the dyes, we may localize both dyes simultaneously and compute their separation. Hence, we have circumvented the Rayleigh limit and achieved nanometer-scale resolution. Specifically, we demonstrate the technique by measuring the distance between single fluorophores separated by 10–20 nm via attachment to the ends of double-stranded DNA molecules immobilized on a surface. In addition to bridging the gap in optical resolution, this technique may be useful for biophysical or genomic applications, including the generation of super-high-density maps of single-nucleotide polymorphisms.},

Targeting of PRC1 to chromatin is thought to be mediated by the Cbx family proteins (Cbx2/4/6/7/8) binding to histone H3 with a K27me3 modification (H3K27me3). Despite this prevailing view, the molecular mechanisms of targeting remain poorly understood. Here, by combining live-cell single-molecule tracking (SMT) and genetic engineering, we reveal that H3K27me3 contributes significantly to the targeting of Cbx7 and Cbx8 to chromatin, but less to Cbx2, Cbx4, and Cbx6. Genetic disruption of the complex formation of PRC1 facilitates the targeting of Cbx7 to chromatin. Biochemical analyses uncover that the CD and AT-hook-like (ATL) motif of Cbx7 constitute a functional DNA-binding unit. Live-cell SMT of Cbx7 mutants demonstrates that Cbx7 is targeted to chromatin by co-recognizing of H3K27me3 and DNA. Our data suggest a novel hierarchical cooperation mechanism by which histone modifications and DNA coordinate to target chromatin regulatory complexes.},

Here we show, from exact solutions, that in the moderate deviation regime x − v 0 t ∝ t 3/4 these fluctuations are precisely described by the finite time KPZ equation, which thus describes the crossover between the Gaussian typical regime and the KPZ fixed point regime for the large deviations. This confirms heuristic arguments given in [2]. These exact results include the discrete model known as the Beta random walk in a time dependent random environment, and a continuum diffusion. They predict the behavior of the maximum of a large number of independent walkers, which should be easier to observe (e.g. in experiments) in this moderate deviations regime.},

We derive exact, compact expressions for the probability density functions (PDFs) of the first passage time (FPT) \$t\$ from a fixed location \$x\_0\$ to the origin for three different realisations of the stochastic diffusivity: a cut-off case \$V(B\_t) ={\textbackslash}Theta(B\_t)\$ (Model I), where \${\textbackslash}Theta(x)\$ is the Heaviside theta function; a Geometric Brownian Motion \$V(B\_t)={\textbackslash}exp(B\_t)\$ (Model II); and a case with \$V(B\_t)=B\_t{\textasciicircum}2\$ (Model III). We realise that, rather surprisingly, the FPT PDF has exactly the L{\textbackslash}'evy-Smirnov form (specific for standard Brownian motion) for Model II, which concurrently exhibits a strongly anomalous diffusion. For Models I and III either the left or right tails (or both) have a different functional dependence on time as compared to the L{\textbackslash}'evy-Smirnov density. In all cases, the PDFs are broad such that already the first moment does not exist. Similar results are obtained in three dimensions for the FPT PDF to an absorbing spherical target.},

	abstract = {Brownian motion is widely used as a model of diffusion in equilibrium media throughout the physical, chemical and biological sciences. However, many real-world systems are intrinsically out of equilibrium owing to energy-dissipating active processes underlying their mechanical and dynamical features1. The diffusion process followed by a passive tracer in prototypical active media, such as suspensions of active colloids or swimming microorganisms2, differs considerably from Brownian motion, as revealed by a greatly enhanced diffusion coefficient3–10 and non-Gaussian statistics of the tracer displacements6,9,10. Although these characteristic features have been extensively observed experimentally, there is so far no comprehensive theory explaining how they emerge from the microscopic dynamics of the system. Here we develop a theoretical framework to model the hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer and the active swimmers, which shows that the tracer follows a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process that accounts for all empirical observations. The theory predicts a long-lived Lévy flight regime11 of the loopy tracer motion with a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The duration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, suggesting that the optimal foraging strategy of swimming microorganisms might depend crucially on their density in order to exploit the Lévy flights of nutrients12. Our framework can be applied to address important theoretical questions, such as the thermodynamics of active systems13, and practical ones, such as the interaction of swimming microorganisms with nutrients and other small particles14 (for example, degraded plastic) and the design of artificial nanoscale machines15.},

Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance.

We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Lévy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

	abstract = {Non-Fickian (or anomalous) transport of contaminants has been observed at field and laboratory scales in a wide variety of porous and fractured geological formations. Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.

The "Ariadne's clew" we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate "anomalous" (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder.

	abstract = {Often sharp changes in cellular behavior are triggered by thresholded events, i.e., by the attainment of a threshold value of a relevant cellular or molecular dynamical variable. Since the governing variable itself typically undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time is called the "first passage" time and the corresponding process is a "first passage" (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques; the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.},

	abstract = {The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.},

Beside being non-carcinogenic, it is non-invasive, the equipment is transportable, and the methodology can be used to examine properties of soft tissue. However, unlike x-ray photons, optical photons generated in the near-infrared suffer significant amounts of scattering by heterogeneous bodies (e.g., organelles) found in biological tissue. Thus, theory is required to interpret experimental data which appear in the form o spatially or temporally varying light patterns on the skin surface. There is a wide range of parameters over which either diffusion theory or the theory of lattice random walks can be called on to translate optical data into medically significant information embodied in optical parameters of the tissue. We discuss several problems in diffusion theory arising in the analysis of optical measurements, for tissues modeled by a semi-infinite or slab geometry, having either isotropic or anisotropic optical parameters. The measured quantities are related to the intensity of light re-emitted on the tissue surface. A brief discussion is given related to the telegrapher’s equation, which has been suggested as a simple way of incorporating the effects of forward scattering. Mention is made of calculations related to layered media which frequently occur in tissues such as skull and esophagus. Finally, we briefly discuss discrete random walk models for photon migration. These have recently been used to provide parameters conveying information related to the region interrogated by photons constrained to reappear on skin surface.},

We then studied gold nanobipyramids and nanostars that have recently gained interest as building blocks for new plasmonic nanosensors. The aim of our study is to determine whether the luminescence of gold nanoparticles of complex shape (bipyramids and nanostars) is a plasmon-assisted process, in line with the conclusions of recent spectroscopic studies on spheres and nanorods. Our study has been performed on particles in suspension in order to avoid any artefact from the heterogeneous environment created when particles are deposited on a substrate. We employ a recently developed photon time-of-flight method in combination with correlation spectroscopy of the light scattered by the particles to probe the luminescent properties of individual particles based on a particle-by-particle spectral analysis. Furthermore, we have performed resonant light scattering spectroscopic measurements on the same samples. Our work demonstrates the power of our time-of flight method for uncovering the plasmonic signatures of individual bipyramids and nanostars during their brief passage in the focal volume of a confocal set-up. These spectral features of individual particles remain hidden in macroscopic measurements. We find that the intrinsic photoluminescence emission of gold bipyramids and gold nanostars is mediated by their localized surface plasmons.},

Methods: The sensitivity of a DLS instrument was first considered on a theoretical level, followed by experiments using DLS instruments, equipped with two different lasers of (nominal) 45 mW, and 100 mW, respectively. This work analyzes dilute colloidal dispersions of lysozyme as model protein. Results: Theoretical findings agreed with experiments in that only enhanced laser power of 100 mW laser allowed measuring a 0.1 mg/mL protein dispersion in a reliable manner. Results confirmed the usefulness of the presented theoretical considerations in improving a general understanding of the limiting factors in DLS. Conclusions: Laser power is a critical aspect regarding adequate colloidal analysis by DLS. Practical guidance is provided to help scientists specifically with measuring dilute samples to choose both an optimal instrument configuration as well as a robust experimental procedure.},

	abstract = {A particle entering a scattering and absorbing medium executes a random walk through a sequence of scattering events. The particle ultimately either achieves first-passage, leaving the medium, or it is absorbed. The Kubelka–Munk model describes a flux of such particles moving perpendicular to the surface of a plane-parallel medium with a scattering rate and an absorption rate. The particle path alternates between the positive direction into the medium and the negative direction back towards the surface. Backscattering events from the positive to the negative direction occur at local maxima or peaks, while backscattering from the negative to the positive direction occur at local minima or valleys. The probability of a particle avoiding absorption as it follows its path decreases exponentially with the path-length λ. The reflectance of a semi-infinite slab is therefore the Laplace transform of the distribution of path-length that ends with a first-passage out of the medium. In the case of a constant scattering rate the random walk is a Poisson process. We verify our results with two iterative calculations, one using the properties of iterated convolution with a symmetric kernel and the other via direct calculation with an exponential step-length distribution. We present a novel demonstration, based on fluctuation theory of sums of random variables, that the first-passage probability as a function of the number of peaks n in the alternating path is a step-length distribution-free combinatoric expression involving Catalan numbers. Counting paths with backscattering on the real half-line results in the same Catalan number coefficients as Dyck paths on the whole numbers. Including a separate forward-scattering Poisson process results in a combinatoric expression related to counting Motzkin paths. We therefore connect walks on the real line to discrete path combinatorics.},

In this technique the solution is approximated by a polynomial at each grid point that its coefficients are determined by solving a linear system of equations. Numerical results show that the compact finite difference approximation of fourth order and collocation method produce a very efficient method for solving the one-space-dimensional linear hyperbolic equation.

A Fabry photometer, attached to the 40-inch refractor at the Yerkes Observatory, was used to measure the brightness of regions over a wide range of galactic latitude. The intensities in the photographic region of the spectrum were calibrated by means of the Polar Sequence stars. The mean of four such runs across the Milky Way, on circles of nearly constant longitude, l = 40°, shows a maximum of brightness of 80 stars of the tenth magnitude per square degree for the diffuse extra-terrestrial radiation. The mean of three runs near l = 140° shows a maximum of 35 in the same units. It is shown that the observed intensity of diffuse light may be explained as scattered stellar radiation if the phase function governing the scattering of starlight by the interstellar matter is strongly forward-throwing. The concentration of the diffuse light toward the galactic circle is also in agreement with this property of the phase function. The observations also indicate that the scattering efficiency, or albedo, of the particles is greater than 0.3},

However, it neglects the ballistic nature of photon propagation between successive scattering events and hence entirely breaks down for short times and distances, as well as for strong absorption. Here we generalize on the exact two-stream theory of one-dimensional photon migration to obtain a telegrapher equation that accounts for both diffusive and ballistic aspects of propagation in three-dimensional media. At long times and distances the standard diffusion theory is recovered, whereas at short times and distances we find improved predictions for such phenomena as pulse spreading, diffuse photon-density wave dispersion, transmission through a slab, and pulse reflection from a semi-infinite medium. Our theory should be useful for accurately characterizing turbid media, such as biological tissues, and may also aid in improving the spatial resolution of images made with diffuse light.},

A crucial step is to model photon transport as a diffusion process. This approach is acceptable for optically thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering; however, it becomes increasingly inaccurate for thinner samples for several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling photon propagation by a telegrapher equation with suitable boundary conditions, we can account for the ballistic transport of photons at finite speed between successive scattering events. By introducing a discontinuity in the photon concentration at the source point, and then averaging over a range of penetration depths, we can account for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the forward direction, rather than being completely randomized at each event. The accuracy of our approach is tested by comparison both with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially designed suspensions of polystyrene spheres. We find that our predictions extend the utility of diffuse transmission to slabs of all thicknesses and of DWS to slabs down to about two transport mean free paths.},

Performing Monte Carlo simulations implementing Mie scattering and mixed boundary conditions, we show that the proposed approach should be feasible with current technology. The results suggest that the optical properties and geometry of the glacier can be extracted from realistic measurements, which could be implemented with a low cost and small footprint.},

We show that in one dimension the mean time to absorption at a boundary for the first ofk diffusing particles, μ1,k, goes as (lnk)−1 for the set of initial conditions in which none of thek particles is located at a boundary and goes ask−2 for the set of initial conditions in which some of thek particles may be located at the boundary. We demonstrate that in one dimension our asymptotic results (k21) are independent of the potential field in which the diffusion takes place for a wide class of potentials. We conjecture that our results are independent of dimension and produce some evidence supporting this conjecture. We conclude with a discussion of the possible import of these results on diffusion-controlled rate processes.},

	abstract = {A variety of systems in physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology are modeled in terms of diffusing ‘searchers’ looking for ‘targets’. Examples range from gene regulation, to cell sensing, to human decision-making. A commonly studied statistic in these models is the so-called hitting probability for each target, which is the probability that a given single searcher finds that particular target. However, the decisive event in many systems is not the arrival of a given single searcher to a target, but rather the arrival of the fastest searcher to a target out of many searchers. In this paper, we study the probability that the fastest diffusive searcher hits a given target in the many searcher limit, which we call the extreme hitting probability. We first prove an upper bound for the decay of the probability that the searcher finds a target other than the closest target. This upper bound applies in very general settings and depends only on the relative distances to the targets. Furthermore, we find the exact asymptotics of the extreme hitting probabilities in terms of the short-time distribution of when a single searcher hits a target. These results show that the fastest searcher always hits the closest target in the many searcher limit. While this fact is intuitive in light of recent results on the time it takes the fastest searcher to find a target, our results give rigorous, quantitative estimates for the extreme hitting probabilities. We illustrate our results in several examples and numerical solutions.},

	abstract = {Biological events are often initiated when a random “searcher” finds a “target,” which is called a first passage time (FPT). In some biological systems involving multiple searchers, an important timescale is the time it takes the slowest searcher(s) to find a target. For example, of the hundreds of thousands of primordial follicles in a woman’s ovarian reserve, it is the slowest to leave that trigger the onset of menopause. Such slowest FPTs may also contribute to the reliability of cell signaling pathways and influence the ability of a cell to locate an external stimulus. In this paper, we use extreme value theory and asymptotic analysis to obtain rigorous approximations to the full probability distribution and moments of slowest FPTs. Though the results are proven in the limit of many searchers, numerical simulations reveal that the approximations are accurate for any number of searchers in typical scenarios of interest. We apply these general mathematical results to models of ovarian aging and menopause timing, which reveals the role of slowest FPTs for understanding redundancy in biological systems. We also apply the theory to several popular models of stochastic search, including search by diffusive, subdiffusive, and mortal searchers.},

	abstract = {Many physical, chemical, and biological systems depend on the first passage time (FPT) of a diffusive searcher to a target. Typically, this FPT is much slower than the characteristic diffusion timescale. For example, this is the case if the target is small (the narrow escape problem) or if the searcher must escape a potential well. However, many systems depend on the first time a searcher finds the target out of a large group of searchers, which is the so-called extreme FPT. Since this extreme FPT vanishes in the limit of many searchers, the prohibitively slow FPTs of diffusive search can be negated by deploying enough searchers. However, the notion of ‘enough searchers’ is poorly understood. How can one determine if a system is in the slow regime (dominated by small targets or a deep potential, for example) or the fast regime (dominated by many searchers)? How can one estimate the extreme FPT in these different regimes? In this paper, we answer these questions by deriving conditions which ensure that a system is in either regime and finding approximations of the full distribution and all the moments of the extreme FPT in these regimes. Our analysis reveals the critical effect that initial searcher distribution and target reactivity can have on extreme FPTs.},

This fastest FPT depends on extremely rare events and has a drastically faster timescale than the FPT of a given single searcher. In this work, we prove a simple explicit formula for every moment of the fastest FPT. The formula is remarkably universal, as it holds for d-dimensional diffusion processes (i) with general space-dependent diffusivities and force fields, (ii) on Riemannian manifolds, (iii) in the presence of reflecting obstacles, and (iv) with partially absorbing targets.

The last decade saw an enlightening series of new results focusing mostly on the so-called mean and global first passage time (MFPT and GFPT, respectively) of such processes. Here we push the understanding of first passage processes one step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.},

General estimates and asymptotics are compared to several explicit solutions for simple domains and to numerical simulations.

While the overwhelming majority of studies have focused on the time it takes a given single Brownian searcher to reach a target, cellular processes are instead often triggered by the arrival of the first molecule out of many molecules. In these scenarios, the more relevant timescale is the FPT of the first Brownian searcher to reach a target from a large group of independent and identical Brownian searchers. Though the searchers are identically distributed, one searcher will reach the target before the others and will thus have the fastest FPT. This fastest FPT depends on extremely rare events and its mean can be orders of magnitude faster than the mean FPT of a given single searcher. In this paper, we use rigorous probabilistic methods to study this fastest FPT. We determine the asymptotic behavior of all the moments of this fastest FPT in the limit of many searchers in a general class of two- and three-dimensional domains. We establish these results by proving that the fastest searcher takes an almost direct path to the target.},

These results are compared with results from time-independent and time-dependent diffusion equations, respectively, where the effects due to internal reflection are incorporated into an average extrapolation length in the boundary conditions. For the static properties, we find an abrupt transition from ballistic to diffusive behavior when sample thickness is about three mean free paths, i.e., L≈3l. The diffusion approximation is valid when L{\textgreater}3l, independent of the amount of internal reflection. For the dynamic properties, both the peak arrival time at short times and the diffusion constant at long times of the transmitted pulse indicate that there is a region of anomalous diffusion when 3l{\textless}L{\textless}Lc. The diffusion constant in this region increases with decreasing L. It also increases with the amount of internal reflection. The physical origin of the existence of such an anomalous region is the resonance-induced wave focusing effect. Due to the presence of internal reflection, the wave energy tends to concentrate in the forward direction at output boundary. It makes direction randomization difficult in the scattered waves. A similar wave focusing effect has been found in resonant tunneling systems of electrons in the presence of elastic scattering. The diffusion approximation is valid when L{\textgreater}Lc. The value of Lc is about ten times the average extrapolation length, i.e., L≈10ze, where ze is a fast increasing function of the amount of internal reflection.},

	abstract = {Four samples of Ludox colloidal silica were studied by the light transmission and angular scattering method and the size of particles determined. It was found essential for light scattering work to centrifuge the original Ludox solution in order to remove the aggregated material. After this treatment each Ludox sample regardless of age could be used successfully for calibration purposes. The apparent particle sizes in aqueous solutions of Ludox were smaller than those in 0.05 M NaCl solutions, the latter being in very good agreement with electron microscopic values. The refractive index increments of Ludox in water and 0.05 M NaCl were determined at three wavelengths. The influence of cell length and blackening of the cells in transmission measurements were also studied. Dissymmetries and depolarizations were small. All results indicated that particles of Ludox behave practically asRayleigh scatterers. The usefulness of these results for the calibration of light scattering photometers is discussed.},

	abstract = {Many events in biology are triggered when a diffusing searcher finds a target, which is called a first passage time (FPT). The overwhelming majority of FPT studies have analyzed the time it takes a single searcher to find a target. However, the more relevant timescale in many biological systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) out of many searchers to find a target, which is called an extreme FPT. In this paper, we apply extreme value theory to find a tractable approximation for the full probability distribution of extreme FPTs of diffusion. This approximation can be easily applied in many diverse scenarios, as it depends on only a few properties of the short time behavior of the survival probability of a single FPT. We find this distribution by proving that a careful rescaling of extreme FPTs converges in distribution as the number of searchers grows. This limiting distribution is a type of Gumbel distribution and involves the LambertW function. This analysis yields new explicit formulas for approximations of statistics of extreme FPTs (mean, variance, moments, etc.) which are highly accurate and are accompanied by rigorous error estimates.},

We find that the image-charge configurations of the partial-current and extrapolated-boundary conditions have the same dipole and quadrupole moments and that the two corresponding solutions to the diffusion equation are approximately equal. In the application of diffusion theory to frequency-domain photon-migration (FDPM) data, these two approaches yield values for the scattering and absorption coefficients that are equal to within 3\%. Moreover, the two boundary conditions can be combined to yield a remarkably simple, accurate, and computationally fast method for extracting values for optical parameters from FDPM data. FDPM data were taken both at the surface and deep inside tissue phantoms, and the difference in data between the two geometries is striking. If one analyzes the surface data without accounting for the boundary, values deduced for the optical coefficients are in error by 50\% or more. As expected, when aluminum foil was placed on the surface of a tissue phantom, phase and modulation data were closer to the results for an infinite-medium geometry. Raising the reflectivity of a tissue surface can, in principle, eliminate the effect of the boundary. However, we find that phase and modulation data are highly sensitive to the reflectivity in the range of 80-100\%, and a minimum value of 98\% is needed to mimic an infinite-medium geometry reliably. We conclude that noninvasive measurements of optically thick tissue require a rigorous treatment of the tissue boundary, and we suggest a unified partial-current--extrapolated boundary approach.},

For such a molecular relay race taking place in infinite one-, two- and three-dimensional systems, we find exact expressions for the probability density function of the time instant of the terminal reaction event, conditioned on preceding successful reaction events on an ordered array of target sites. The obtained expressions pertain to the most general conditions: number of intermediate stages and the corresponding diffusion coefficients, the sizes of the target sites, the distances between them, as well as their reactivities are arbitrary.},

The present approach provides an essentially axiom-deduction development of the theory of radiative transfer (albeit via several ill-evaluated approximations) within the context of which various processes and their interrelationships may be investigated. Most of these processes have hitherto been studied only phenomenologically and usually piecemeal. Specific application to photon scattering, cyclotron radiation, recombination radiation, de-excitation radiation, and bremsstrahlung is made in the test. The derivation of an H-theorem for photon-particle systems is sketched; and contact is made with the usual statistical mechanical treatment of the equilibrium states of such systems. It is also shown that some aspects of collective particle behavior can be introduced quite naturally into the description of photon transport in the fully ionized plasma.},

From simple momentum transfer considerations a diffusion equation is derived to describe the diffusion rate as the nature of the process changes from ordinary mutual diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. This equation is shown to give good agreement with experimental measurements of diffusion rates in porous solids.

At pressures for which the mean free path λ≫a, the result in the limit L→∞ reduces to that already obtained by M. Knudsen, the diffusion coefficient D being given by 2a¯v3, where ¯v is the mean molecular speed. For a capillary of finite length the diffusion coefficient is, to first order in aL, smaller than this by a factor 1−3a4L. In the opposite limit of high pressures, for which λ≪a, the result reduces to the elementary kinetic theory expression for the self diffusion coefficient, D=λ¯v3. One of the most significant features of the result is that in a long tube the diffusion coefficient drops very rapidly with increasing pressure from its initial value for λ≫L. Thus the initial slope of D as a function of pressure is given by dDd(aλ)≅−12¯va lnLa. It is shown that these results account for the anomalous low pressure minima observed by several investigators who have measured the specific flow GΔp through long capillary tubes as a function of mean pressure ¯p. The failure to observe such minima with porous media, for which effectively L≈a in each pore, is also explained by these results. The formulae obtained here represent a rigorous solution to the long capillary diffusion problem, valid at all pressures and subject only to the limitations of the mean free path type of treatment.},

The long time diffusion coefficient for a system in the crossover regime can be described in terms of a hopping time, which measures the time it takes for a particle to escape the cage formed by its neighbours. In this paper, we develop a transition state theory approach to the calculation of the hopping time, using the small system isobaric–isothermal ensemble to rigorously account for the volume fluctuations associated with the size of the cage. We also describe a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that can be used to calculate the free energy barrier for particle hopping. The theory and simulation method correctly predict the hopping times for a two-dimensional confined ideal gas system and a system of confined hard discs over a range of channel radii, but the method breaks down for wide channels in the hard discs’ case, underestimating the height of the hopping barrier due to the neglect of interactions between the small system and its surroundings.},

	abstract = {Odorants are detected by olfactory receptors on the sensory cilia of olfactory receptor cells (ORCs). These cylindrical cilia have a diameters of 100–200 nm, within which the components required for signal transduction by the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP system are located. The kinetics of odorant responses are determined by the lifetimes of active proteins as well as the production, diffusion, and extrusion/degradation of second messenger molecules (cAMP and Ca2+). However, there is limited information about the molecular kinetics of ORC responses, mostly because of the technical limitations involved in studying such narrow spaces and fine structures. In this study, using a combination of electrophysiology, photolysis of caged substances, and spot UV laser stimulation, we show that second messenger molecules work only in the vicinity of their site of generation in the olfactory cilia. Such limited spreading clearly explains a unique feature of ORCs, namely, the integer multiple of unitary events that they display in low Ca2+ conditions. Although the small ORC uses cAMP and Ca2+ for various functions in different regions of the cell, these substances seem to operate only in the compartment that has been activated by the appropriate stimulus. We also show that these substances remain in the same vicinity for a long time. This enables the ORC to amplify the odorant signal and extend the lifetime of Ca2+-dependent adaptation. Cytoplasmic buffers and extrusion/degradation systems seem to play a crucial role in limiting molecular spreading. In addition, binding sites on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane may limit molecular diffusion in such a narrow space because of the high surface/volume ratio. Such efficient energy conversion may also be broadly used in other biological systems that have not yet been subjected to systematic experiments.},

	abstract = {Significance: Most radiative transport problems in turbid media are typically associated with mm or cm scales, leading to typical time scales in the range of hundreds of ps or more. In certain cases, however, much thinner layers can also be relevant, which can dramatically alter the overall transport properties of a scattering medium. Studying scattering in these thin layers requires ultrafast detection techniques and adaptations to the common Monte Carlo (MC) approach. Aim: We aim to discuss a few relevant aspects for the simulation of light transport in thin scattering membranes, and compare the obtained numerical results with experimental measurements based on an all-optical gating technique. Approach: A thin membrane with controlled scattering properties based on polymer-dispersed TiO2 nanoparticles is fabricated for experimental validation. Transmittance measurements are compared against a custom open-source MC implementation including specific pulse profiles for tightly focused femtosecond laser pulses. Results: Experimental transmittance data of ultrafast pulses through a thin scattering sample are compared with MC simulations in the spatiotemporal domain to retrieve its scattering properties. The results show good agreement also at short distances and time scales. Conclusions: When simulating light transport in scattering membranes with thicknesses in the orders of tens of micrometer, care has to be taken when describing the temporal, spatial, and divergence profiles of the source term, as well as the possible truncation of step length distributions, which could be introduced by simple strategies for the generation of random exponentially distributed variables.},

We take advantage of the limited validity of the diffusion approximation of light transport and demonstrate, experimentally and numerically, that even deep into the multiple scattering regime, time-resolved detection of transmitted light allows simultaneous assessment of both single scattering anisotropy and scattering mean free path, and therefore also macroscopic parameters like the diffusion constant and the transport mean free path. This is achieved via careful assessment of early light and matching against Monte Carlo simulations of radiative transfer.},

	abstract = {Transport processes underpin a wide variety of phenomena, ranging from chemistry, to physics and ecology. Despite their pervasiveness, however, several distinctive features of these processes are still elusive, making it difficult to recognize and classify the associated transport regimes. Using light scattering as a probe to explore different propagation regimes, we report on the experimental observation of non-self-similar light transport through turbid membranes. Our results show that a breakdown of self-similarity can arise for light waves even in the presence of isotropic and homogeneous disorder, and can be tuned by varying the turbidity of the system. By introducing the concept of self-similarity for light propagation, we provide a unified framework for the classification of light transport regimes—overcoming the dichotomy between normal and anomalous diffusion—and show that non-self-similar propagation is a common and experimentally accessible phenomenon. This insight can help to understand and model other scenarios where light transport is dominated by rare propagation events, such as in nonlinear and active media, but also in other fields of research beyond optics.},

Based on a large set of simulated data, we build a freely available look-up table routine enabling reliable and precise determination of the microscopic transport parameters starting from robust observables which are independent from absolute intensity measurements.

Even so, the link between the three-dimensional (3D) spatial distribution of the scattering elements and the resulting opacity is still lively debated to date due to different experimental conditions, range of parameters explored, or sample formulations. On the other hand, a unified numerical survey with controlled parameters has been impractical up to date due to the sheer computational power required to address samples with representative size. In this work, we exploit a graphics processing unit implementation of the T-matrix method to investigate the complete range of particle volume concentration and packing-induced spatial correlations, allowing us to reveal and elucidate a twofold role played by spatial correlations in either enhancing or suppressing opacity. By applying these findings to the illustrative case of white paint, we determine the optimal combination of density and spatial correlations corresponding to the highest opacity.},

The son of a brewer, he began studying heat while investigating how to increase the efficiency of electric motors. His discovery of the relationship between heat and energy contributed to the discovery of the conservation of energy and the first law of thermodynamics. Volume 1 of Joule's scientific papers was published in 1884. It is organised chronologically and reveals the range of Joule's interests and the development of his thought. The topics of the papers include the measurement of heat, voltaic batteries, electromagnets, specific heat, meteorology and thermodynamics. Joule's careful experiments in these areas were fundamental to the development of significant areas of twentieth-century physics, although he was slow to gain recognition from his contemporaries.},

First, an infinite order partial differential equation is obtained for the velocity space solid angle-averaged phase-space distribution of particles which underwent at least a few collisions. It is shown that, in the lowest order asymptotic expansion, this equation simplifies to the well-known diffusion equation. The second-order asymptotic expansion for isotropic small-angle scattering results in a modified telegraph equation with a signal propagation speed of v(5/11) exp 1/2 instead of the usual v/3 exp 1/2. Our derivation of a modified telegraph equation follows from an expansion of the Boltzmann equation in the relevant smallness parameters and not from a truncation of an eigenfunction expansion. This equation is consistent with causality. It is shown that, under steady state conditions in a convecting plasma, the telegraph equation may be regarded as a diffusion equation with a modified transport coefficient, which describes a combination of diffusion and cosmic-ray inertia.},

	abstract = {We develop the asymptotic P 1 approximation for the time-dependent thermal radiative transfer equation for a multidimensional general geometry. Careful derivation of the asymptotic P 1 equations, directly from the time-dependent Boltzmann equation, yields a particle velocity that is closer (v≈0.91c) to the exact value of c but is based on an asymptotic analysis rather than diffusion theory (infinite velocity) or conventional P 1 theory (which gives rise to the Telegrapher’s equation, ). While this approach does not match the exact value of c as does the P 1/3 method, the latter method is an ad hoc approach that has not been justified on theoretical grounds. This article provides the theoretical justification for the almost-correct value of c that yields improved results for the well-known (one-dimensional) Su-Olson benchmark for radiative transfer, for which we obtain a semi-analytic solution in the case of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We found that the asymptotic P 1 approximation yields a better solution than the diffusion, the classic P 1, and the P 1/3 approximations, yielding the correct steady-state behavior for the energy density and the (almost) correct particle velocity.},

To begin with, half move in each direction. Thereafter, and at the end of each successive interval of time τ, each particle starts a new partial path; it still moves with speed υ, and there is a probability p that it will continue to move in the same direction as in its previous path, and a probability q (= 1−p) that the direction of its velocity will be reversed, so the directions in any two consecutive intervals are correlated with a correlation coefficient c=p−q. The partial correlations for non-consecutive intervals are zero. The difference equation is found for the fraction γ(n,ν) of the number of particles at a distance y=νυτ from the origin after a time t=nτ; it is shown how γ(n,ν) may be computed; asymptotic formulae for large n are found, both for a fixed value p/q and for a fixed value of nq/p. The limiting density distribution (and the limiting characteristic function) are found when n→∞, τ→0, with nτ=t, νυτ=y, and in the limiting operation c=1−τ/A, with A constant, so that c→1, and the speed υ is kept constant; the limiting form of the difference equation is the telegraph equation, with υ2=(LC)−1, A=L/R, where L, C, and R are the self-inductance, capacitance, and resistance per unit length; and the limiting density distribution is the solution of this equation for an instantaneous source. If p+q≠1, and there is, at the end of each interval of time τ, a non-zero probability, 1−p−q, that a particle will escape from the system, then the same limiting operation, with T/(1−p−q)=G, G constant, leads to the telegraph equation with leakage, the leakage resistance being G/C. The solution of the telegraph equation is further considered (and in particular is given in terms of Lommel's function of two variables) when one end of a long cable is held at a constant potential for t≥0.},

The author begins with a presentation of fundamental theory including the connection between the occupation and first-passage probabilities of a random walk, and the connection to electrostatics and current flows in resistor networks. The consequences of this theory are then developed for simple, illustrative geometries including the finite and semi-infinite intervals, fractal networks, spherical geometries and the wedge. Various applications are presented including neuron dynamics, self-organized criticality, diffusion-limited aggregation, the dynamics of spin systems and the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions. First-passage processes provide an appealing way for graduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry, theoretical biology, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, operations research and finance to understand all of these systems.},

The MATLAB-based codes using Mie theory for both spherical and cylindrical models were developed and applied for studying the light propagation and the key scattering properties of the discrete particles. The optical and structural parameters of tissue such as the index of refraction of cytoplasm, size of nuclei, and the diameter of the nucleoli for cancerous and normal human tissues obtained from the previous biological, biomedical, and bio-optic studies were used for Mie theory simulation and calculation. The wavelength dependence of scattering coefficient, anisotropy factor, and reduced scattering coefficients were investigated in the wide spectral range from 300 to 2400nm. The scattering particle size dependence of μs, g, and scattering angular distributions was studied. The results show that larger size scattering particles have more contribution to the forward scattering in comparison with the smaller particles. In addition to the conventional simulation model that approximately considers the scattering particles as spheres, the cylinder model that is more suitable for fiber-like tissue frame components such as collagen and elastin was used for developing a computation code to study angular dependence of light scattering in turbid particle media and tissue for the first time.},

	abstract = {The first-passage time for a single diffusing particle has been studied extensively, but the first-passage time of a system of many diffusing particles, as is often the case in physical systems, has received little attention until recently. We consider two models for many-particle diffusion—one treats each particle as independent simple random walkers while the other treats them as coupled to a common space-time random forcing field that biases particles nearby in space and time in similar ways. The first-passage time of a single diffusing particle under both models shows the same statistics and scaling behavior. However, for many-particle diffusions, the first-passage time among all particles (the extreme first-passage time) is very different between the two models, effected in the latter case by the randomness of the common forcing field. We develop an asymptotic (in the number of particles and location where first passage is being probed) theoretical framework to separate the impact of the random environment with that of the sampling trajectories within it. We identify a power law describing the impact of the environment on the variance of the extreme first-passage time. Through numerical simulations, we verify that the predictions from this asymptotic theory hold even for systems with widely varying numbers of particles, all the way down to 100 particles. This shows that measurements of the extreme first-passage time for many-particle diffusions provide an indirect measurement of the underlying environment in which the diffusion is occurring.},

Apart from the basic capabilities of lidar for detecting backscattering from atmospheric constituents, possibilities exist for more sophisticated techniques based on the wave nature of the energy. The basic capabilities of lidar, however, make it possible to observe the atmosphere with previously unknown resolution and sensitivity. Apart from providing new information about clouds, lidar has shown that the concentration of the particulate matter content of clear air is highly variable and that such variations can indicate the structure and motion of the clear atmosphere. These capabilities have applications in atmospheric and meteorological research and various operational activities.},

When mortality is irrelevant, the search time scales as 𝜏𝐷/ln⁡𝑁 for ln⁡𝑁≫1, where 𝜏𝐷∼𝐿2/𝐷 is the diffusive time scale. Conversely, when the mortality rate 𝜇 of the searchers is sufficiently large, the search time scales as √𝜏𝐷/𝜇, independent of 𝑁. When searchers have distinct and high mortalities, a subpopulation with a nontrivial optimal diffusivity is most likely to reach the target.

The activation rate is set by extremely rare events, which have drastically different time scales from the mean times between activations, and depends on different structural parameters. This shift calls for reconsideration of physical processes used in deterministic and stochastic modeling of chemical reactions that are based on the traditional forward rate, especially for fast activation processes in living cells. Consequently, the biological activation time is not necessarily exponentially distributed. We review here the physical models, the mathematical analysis and the new paradigm of setting the scale to be the shortest time for activation that clarifies the role of population redundancy in selecting and accelerating transient cellular search processes. We provide examples in cellular transduction, gene activation, cell senescence activation or spermatozoa selection during fertilization, where the rate depends on numbers. We conclude that the statistics of the minimal time to activation set kinetic laws in biology, which can be very different from the ones associated to average times.},

The optimization framework proposed allows us to include novel path-dependent measures of risk and return in the asset allocation problem. An empirical application to S\&P 100 companies, a risk-free asset and stock indices is provided. Our empirical results suggest that the proposed framework exhibits more consistency between in-sample and out-of-sample performance than the mean-variance model and an alternative optimization problem that minimizes the MaxVaR measure of Boudoukh et al.

First-passage-time distribution for Wiener processes has a single peak, while that for stocks exhibits a notable second peak within a trading day. This feature has only been discussed sporadically—often dismissed as due to insufficient/incorrect data or circumvented by conversion to tick time—and to the best of our knowledge has not been explained in terms of the underlying stochastic process. It was shown previously that intra-day variations in the market can be modeled by a stochastic process containing two variable-diffusion processes (Hua et al. in, Physica A 419:221–233, 2015). We show here that the first-passage-time distribution of this two-stage variable-diffusion model does exhibit a behavior similar to the empirical observation.

We start with the integral and differential equations for the two-frequency mutual coherence function under the first-order smoothing approximation, and a general diffusion equation and boundary conditions are obtained.

This process had important applications concerning the path-integral solution and the probabilistic interpretation of the 1\$\$+\$\$1 dimensions Dirac equation. The extension to 3\$\$+\$\$1 dimensions requires that the particle only moves at light-speed, which implies that velocity can be represented as a point on the surface of a sphere of radius c. The realizations of the process for the velocity only may connect these points, and, by strict analogy with the Kac model, it can be assumed that the velocity jumps from one value to another. In this paper we follow a new and different strategy assuming that the velocity performs continuous trajectories (velocity changes direction in a continuous way) which are the realization of a Wiener process on the surface. The processes which emerge transform one in the other by Lorentz boost. The associate Forward Kolmogorov Equation for the joint probability density of position and velocity, which is the (3\$\$+\$\$1) dimensional analogous of the telegrapher equation, is examined and a simplification is performed by means of variables separation.},

	abstract = {Background: Elucidation of the highly forward scattering of photons in random media such as biological tissue is crucial for further developments of optical imaging using photon transport models. We evaluated length and time scales of the photon scattering in three-dimensional media. Methods: We employed analytical solutions of the time-dependent radiative transfer, M-th order delta-Eddington, and photon diffusion equations (RTE, dEM, and PDE). We calculated the fluence rates at different source-detector distances and optical properties. Results: We found that the zeroth order dEM and PDE, which approximate the highly forward scattering to the isotropic scattering, are valid in longer length and time scales than approximately     10 /  μ t ′      and     40 /  μ t ′  v    , respectively, where     μ t ′     is the reduced transport coefficient and v the speed of light in a medium. The first and second order dEM, which approximate the highly forward-peaked phase function by the first two and three Legendre moments, are valid in the longer scales than approximately     4.0 /  μ t ′      and     6.3 /  μ t ′  v    ;     2.8 /  μ t ′      and     3.5 /  μ t ′  v    , respectively. The boundary conditions less influence the length scales, while they reduce the times scales from those for bulk at the longer length scale than approximately     4.0 /  μ t ′     . Conclusion: Our findings are useful for constructions of accurate and efficient photon transport models. We evaluated length and time scales of the highly forward scattering of photons in various kinds of three-dimensional random media by analytical solutions of the radiative transfer, M-th order delta-Eddington, and photon diffusion equations.},

Experimental tests of this simple model in tissue-simulating liquid phantoms of different geometries are presented here. The results of these tests show that, in a semi-infinite phantom, the application of the diffusion model provides estimates of the absorption and transport-scattering coefficients that are accurate to better than 10\%. Comparable accuracy was also obtained with this simple model for finite slab, cylindrical, and spherical volumes as long as the objects were of sufficient size.

The presented theory exploits the concept of probability density function f(z{\textbar}ρ, t) for the maximum depth reached by the photons that are eventually re-emitted from the surface of the medium at distance ρ and time t. Analytical formulas for f, for the mean maximum depth 〈zmax〉 and for the mean average depth reached by the detected photons at the surface of a diffusive slab are derived within the framework of the diffusion approximation to the radiative transfer equation, both in the time domain and the continuous wave domain. Validation of the theory by means of comparisons with Monte Carlo simulations is also presented.

	abstract = {A photon transport model for light migration in turbid media based on a cumulant approximation to radiative transfer is presented for image reconstruction inside an infinite medium or a bounded medium with a planar geometry. This model treats weak inhomogeneities through a Born approximation of the Boltzmann radiative transfer equation and uses the second-order cumulant solution of photon density to the Boltzmann equation as the Green’s function for the uniform background. It provides the correct behavior of photon migration at early times and reduces at long times to the center-moved diffusion approximation. At early times, it agrees much better with the result from the Monte Carlo simulation than the diffusion approximation. Both approximations agree well with the Monte Carlo simulation at later times. The weight function for image reconstruction under this proposed model is shown to have a strong dependence at both early and later times on absorption and/or scattering inhomogeneities located in the propagation direction of and close to the source, or in the field of view of and close to the detector. This effect originates from the initial ballistic motion of incident photons, which is substantially underestimated by the diffusion approximation.},

Different types of disordered systems exhibiting anomalous diffusion are presented (the incipient infinite percolation cluster, diffusion-limited aggregation clusters, lattice animals, and random combs), and scaling theories as well as numerical simulations of greater sophistication are described.

	abstract = {A method is described for optical constant estimation and particle sizing in granular samples using diffuse reflectance measurements. Statistical descriptors of the time-resolved photon distributions were used to obtain information inherent to absorption and scattering processes in a sample. Changes in a sample’s absorption and scattering properties and apparent particle diameter were simultaneously estimated using stepwise multi-linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLS). Models were constructed using time-distributions taken at both single and multiple radial displacements between source and detector. SMLR estimates of absorption and particle diameter required descriptors related to the trailing and rising edges of the time profiles, respectively. The inclusion of multi-perspective information allowed for improved estimates for all quantities. Using statistical descriptors, a robust means for simplifying complex photon time-distributions into measurable parameters was found. It was found that the SMLR model gave slightly better results compared with the PLS model. The absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient and apparent particle diameter were estimated to within 10, 9 and 7\% of their respective reference values with SMLR. In the future, this approach may be used as a means in which to develop practical instrumentation for on-line, real-time characterisation of absorbing granular media.},

Time-of-flight distributions were analyzed using Haar transform with selection of the most parsimonious set of wavelets by genetic algorithm optimization. Results showed that the scattering coefficient could be estimated with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.4\% and r2=0.95 using wavelets of frequency up to 400MHz. Absorption coefficients were estimated with a CV of 6.9\% and r2=0.99 using steady-state intensity of blank- and scatter-corrected data. Furthermore, it was shown that quantification using simplified electronics can estimate scattering to within 7.2\% (r2=0.88) and absorption with an error of 8.3\% (r2=0.99).

The conditional probability function u for the cell moving inside such domains (tissue) fulfills by assumption a diffusion–advection equation that is subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer boundary and a Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary. The mean first-passage time (MFPT) function determined by u estimates the average time for the travelling cell to reach various interesting targets. The MFPT function fulfills a Poisson equation inside a domain with suitable boundary conditions, which give rise to various mathematical problems. The main novelty of this study is the characterization of such an MFPT function inside an annulus and an annular cylinder, which is subject to a Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary and a Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer one, and these are integral functions whose densities are the solution of an inhomogeneous system of linear integral equations.},

	abstract = {The mean first passage time (MFPT) of random walks is a key quantity characterizing dynamic processes on disordered media. In a random fractal embedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law scaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal exponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by the distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The role of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk centrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality, dubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT from a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between direct paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT displays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct paths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are dominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different scaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two dimensional square lattices.},

Several authors developed telegrapher’s equations in the well known P1 approximation. The method used in this paper is different: it is based on the asymptotic evaluation of the solutions of the equation of radiative transport with respect to place and time for all values of the albedo. Various coefficients for the telegrapher’s equations were derived, restricted to the case of isotropic scattering, and their properties are discussed. A correct diffusion coefficient for the stationary case could be obtained. However, this solution did not lead to the correct phase velocity. Correct phase velocities in combination with a correct diffusion coefficient were found for a dispersion relation that corresponds with anisotropic Henyey–Greenstein scattering with g=0.22. It provides a time-dependent description of the fluence rate with validity for all values of the albedo.},

	abstract = {In many-particle diffusions, particles that move the furthest and fastest can play an outsized role in physical phenomena. A theoretical understanding of the behavior of such extreme particles is nascent. A classical model, in the spirit of Einstein's treatment of single-particle diffusion, has each particle taking independent homogeneous random walks. This, however, neglects the fact that all particles diffuse in a common and often inhomogeneous environment that can affect their motion. A more sophisticated model treats this common environment as a space-time random biasing field which influences each particle's independent motion. While the bulk (or typical particle) behavior of these two models has been found to match to high degree, recent theoretical work of G. Barraquand and I. Corwin, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 167, 1057 (2017) and G. Barraquand and P. Le Doussal, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53, 215002 (2020) on a one-dimensional exactly solvable version of this random environment model suggests that the extreme behavior is quite different between the two models. We transform these asymptotic (in system size and time) results into physically applicable predictions. Using high-precision numerical simulations we reconcile different asymptotic phases in a manner that matches numerics down to realistic system sizes, amenable to experimental confirmation. We characterize the behavior of extreme diffusion in the random environment model by the presence of a new phase with anomalous fluctuations related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class and equation.},

In the present work we show how the continuous diffusion equations in 2D and 3D of PRW, in the weak coupling limit, provide an alternative theory for mesoscopic photon diffusion, showing that this problem can be studied using either the traditional telegrapher’s equation or by the new approach provided by the continuum and discrete versions of PRW.},

The long time diffusion coefficient for a system in the crossover regime can be described in terms of a hopping time, which measures the time it takes for a particle to escape the cage formed by its neighbours. In this paper, we develop a transition state theory approach to the calculation of the hopping time, using the small system isobaric– isothermal ensemble to rigorously account for the volume fluctuations associated with the size of the cage. We also describe a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that can be used to calculate the free energy barrier for particle hopping. The theory and simulation method correctly predict the hopping times for a two-dimensional confined ideal gas system and a system of confined hard discs over a range of channel radii, but the method breaks down for wide channels in the hard discs' case, underestimating the height of the hopping barrier due to the neglect of interactions between the small system and its surroundings.},

	abstract = {We study space-time fluctuations around a characteristic line for a one-dimensional interacting system known as the random average process. The state of this system is a real-valued function on the integers. New values of the function are created by averaging previous values with random weights. The fluctuations analyzed occur on the scale n{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} where n is the ratio of macroscopic and microscopic scales in the system. The limits of the fluctuations are described by a family of Gaussian processes. In cases of known product-form equilibria, this limit is a two-parameter process whose time marginals are fractional Brownian motions with Hurst parameter 1/4. Along the way we study the limits of quenched mean processes for a random walk in a space-time random environment. These limits also happen at scale n{\textasciicircum}\{1/4\} and are described by certain Gaussian processes that we identify. In particular, when we look at a backward quenched mean process, the limit process is the solution of a stochastic heat equation.},

	abstract = {Non-Fickian (or anomalous) transport of contaminants has been observed at field and laboratory scales in a wide variety of porous and fractured geological formations. Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.

A Brief Introduction The main theme of this series of lectures are "Random motions in random me{\textbackslash}- dia". The subject gathers a variety of probabilistic models often originated from physical sciences such as solid state physics, physical chemistry, oceanography, biophysics . . . , in which typically some diffusion mechanism takes place in an inho{\textbackslash}- mogeneous medium. Randomness appears at two levels. It comes in the description of the motion of the particle diffusing in the medium, this is a rather traditional point of view for probability theory; but it also comes in the very description of the medium in which the diffusion takes place.},

The "Ariadne's clew" we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate "anomalous" (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder.

We provide both a clear physical picture of the process and a variety of analytical techniques. As the average bias μ is increased, a succession of different “diffusion laws” is observed: Sinai's diffusion (μ = 0, x2 {\textbackslash}backsimeq ln4t), anomalous drift (x {\textbackslash}backsimeq tμ, μ {\textless} 1), anomalous dispersion (x - Vt {\textbackslash}backsimeq {\textbackslash}pmt1μ, 1 {\textless} μ {\textless} 2), and finally normal diffusion (μ {\textgreater} 2), apart from algebraic tails outside the scaling region. We show that all those results can be understood in simple terms through a large scale description of the problem as a directed walk among traps characterized by a broad distribution of release time. From this analysis, the full asymptotic probability distributions (averaged over disorder) are precisely determined, in terms of Lévy stable laws. Sample to sample fluctuations are discussed. The probability of presence at the initial point is more specifically adressed. It amounts to computing the density of states of a Schrödinger equation with a special type of random potential. We obtain exactly the average over disorder of this quantity, using the following two different approaches: the “Dyson-Schmidt” technique, and the replica method. Both reveal interesting technical features, and the latter can be used to obtain information on the full probability distribution (and Green function). Some physical applications of this model are discussed.},

This class is called the Kardar– Parisi– Zhang (KPZ) universality class and underlying it is, again, a continuum object — a non-linear stochastic partial differential equation — known as the KPZ equation. The purpose of this survey is to explain the context for, as well as the content of a number of mathematical breakthroughs which have culminated in the derivation of the exact formula for the distribution function of the KPZ equation started with narrow wedge initial data. In particular we emphasize three topics: (1) The approximation of the KPZ equation through the weakly asymmetric simple exclusion process; (2) The derivation of the exact one-point distribution of the solution to the KPZ equation with narrow wedge initial data; (3) Connections with directed polymers in random media.

	abstract = {The nonequilibrium dynamics of classical random Ising spin chains with nonconserved magnetization are studied using an asymptotically exact real space renormalization group (RSRG). We focus on random field Ising model (RFIM) spin chains with and without a uniform applied field, as well as on Ising spin glass chains in an applied field. For the RFIM we consider a universal regime where the random field and the temperature are both much smaller than the exchange coupling. In this regime, the Imry-Ma length that sets the scale of the equilibrium correlations is large and the coarsening of domains from random initial conditions (e.g., a quench from high temperature) occurs over a wide range of length scales. The two types of domain walls that occur diffuse in opposite random potentials, of the form studied by Sinai, and domain walls annihilate when they meet. Using the RSRG we compute many universal asymptotic properties of both the nonequilibrium dynamics and the equilibrium limit. We find that the configurations of the domain walls converge rapidly toward a set of system-specific time-dependent positions that are independent of the initial conditions. Thus the behavior of this nonequilibrium system is pseudodeterministic at long times because of the broad distributions of barriers that occur on the long length scales involved. Specifically, we obtain the time dependence of the energy, the magnetization, and the distribution of domain sizes (found to be statistically independent). The equilibrium limits agree with known exact results. We obtain the exact scaling form of the two-point equal time correlation function ¯łangleS0(t)Sx(t){\textbackslash}rangle and the two-time autocorrelations ¯łangleS0(t')S0(t){\textbackslash}rangle. We also compute the persistence properties of a single spin, of local magnetization, and of domains. The analogous quantities for the {\textbackslash}pmJ Ising spin glass in an applied field are obtained from the RFIM via a gauge transformation. In addition to these we compute the two-point two-time correlation function ¯łangleS0(t)Sx(t){\textbackslash}ranglełangleS0(t')Sx(t'){\textbackslash}rangle which can in principle be measured by experiments on spin-glass-like systems. The thermal fluctuations are studied and found to be dominated by rare events; in particular all moments of truncated equal time correlations are computed. Physical properties which are typically measured in aging experiments are also studied, focusing on the response to a small magnetic field which is applied after waiting for the system to equilibrate for a time tw. The nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation ratio X(t,tw) is computed. We find that for (t-tw){\textbackslash}simt{\textasciicircum}αw with {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha{\textless}1, the ratio equal to its equilibrium value X=1, although time translational invariance does not hold in this regime. For t-tw{\textbackslash}simtw the ratio exhibits an aging regime with a nontrivial X=X(t/tw){\textbackslash}neq1, but the behavior is markedly different from mean field theory. Finally the distribution of the total magnetization and of the number of domains is computed for large finite size systems. General issues about convergence toward equilibrium and the possibilities of weakly history-dependent evolution in other random systems are discussed.},

	abstract = {We study the diffusion of a tracer particle, which moves in continuum space between a lattice of excluded volume, immobile non-inert obstacles. In particular, we analyse how the strength of the tracer-obstacle interactions and the volume occupancy of the crowders alter the diffusive motion of the tracer. From the details of partitioning of the tracer diffusion modes between trapping states when bound to obstacles and bulk diffusion, we examine the degree of localisation of the tracer in the lattice of crowders. We study the properties of the tracer diffusion in terms of the ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements, the trapping time distributions, the amplitude variation of the time averaged mean squared displacements, and the non-Gaussianity parameter of the diffusing tracer. We conclude that tracer-obstacle adsorption and binding triggers a transient anomalous diffusion. From a very narrow spread of recorded individual time averaged trajectories we exclude continuous type random walk processes as the underlying physical model of the tracer diffusion in our system. For moderate tracer-crowder attraction the motion is found to be fully ergodic, while at stronger attraction strength a transient disparity between ensemble and time averaged mean squared displacements occurs. We also put our results into perspective with findings from experimental single-particle tracking and simulations of the diffusion of tagged tracers in dense crowded suspensions. Our results have implications for the diffusion, transport, and spreading of chemical components in highly crowded environments inside living cells and other structured liquids.},

Here we push the understanding of first passage processes one step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.},

We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing Lévy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

Measurements of the functional form of the ballistic-to-diffusive transition provide direct measurements of the temperature, viscosity, and tracer radius.

	abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that the diffusive motion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarizing their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a sublinear, power-law increase of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations in time, non-Gaussian distributions of spatial displacements, heterogeneous diffusion and a fraction of immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarize some widely used theoretical models: Gaussian models like fractional Brownian motion and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the continuous-time random walk model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Particular emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of two-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even if the MSDs are identical. Then, we review the theory underlying commonly applied experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport like single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where a variety of model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations are discussed which play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings.

	abstract = {Observation of the Brownian motion of a small probe interacting with its environment provides one of the main strategies for characterizing soft matter. Essentially, two counteracting forces govern the motion of the Brownian particle. First, the particle is driven by rapid collisions with the surrounding solvent molecules, referred to as thermal noise. Second, the friction between the particle and the viscous solvent damps its motion. Conventionally, the thermal force is assumed to be random and characterized by a Gaussian white noise spectrum. The friction is assumed to be given by the Stokes drag, suggesting that motion is overdamped at long times in particle tracking experiments, when inertia becomes negligible. However, as the particle receives momentum from the fluctuating fluid molecules, it also displaces the fluid in its immediate vicinity. The entrained fluid acts back on the particle and gives rise to long-range correlations. This hydrodynamic /`memory/' translates to thermal forces, which have a coloured, that is, non-white, noise spectrum. One hundred years after Perrin/'s pioneering experiments on Brownian motion, direct experimental observation of this colour is still elusive. Here we measure the spectrum of thermal noise by confining the Brownian fluctuations of a microsphere in a strong optical trap. We show that hydrodynamic correlations result in a resonant peak in the power spectral density of the sphere/'s positional fluctuations, in strong contrast to overdamped systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate different strategies to achieve peak amplification. By analogy with microcantilever-based sensors, our results reveal that the particle-fluid-trap system can be considered a nanomechanical resonator in which the intrinsic hydrodynamic backflow enhances resonance. Therefore, instead of being treated as a disturbance, details in thermal noise could be exploited for the development of new types of sensor and particle-based assay in lab-on-a-chip applications.},

However, instantaneous velocity has eluded experimental observation for more than a century since Einstein's prediction of the small length and time scales involved. We report shot-noise– limited, high-bandwidth measurements of Brownian motion of micrometer-sized beads suspended in water and acetone by an optical tweezer. We observe the hydrodynamic instantaneous velocity of Brownian motion in a liquid, which follows a modified energy equipartition theorem that accounts for the kinetic energy of the fluid displaced by the moving bead. We also observe an anticorrelated thermal force, which is conventionally assumed to be uncorrelated. Beyond Brownian Motion On long time scales, the random Brownian motion of particles diffusing in a liquid is well described by theories developed by Einstein and others, but the instantaneous or short time scale behavior has been much harder to observe or analyze.

	abstract = {Often sharp changes in cellular behavior are triggered by thresholded events, i.e., by the attainment of a threshold value of a relevant cellular or molecular dynamical variable. Since the governing variable itself typically undergoes noisy or stochastic dynamics, there is a corresponding variability in the times when the same change occurs in each cell of a population. This time is called the "first passage" time and the corresponding process is a "first passage" (FP) process, referring to the event when a random variable first passes the threshold value. In this review we first present and elucidate fundamentals of the FP formalism within a unified conceptual framework, which naturally integrates the existing techniques. We then discuss applications thereof, with emphasis on the practical use of FP techniques in biophysical systems. Our focus here is on covering a diverse set of analytical techniques; the number of reviewed biological applications is thus limited, out of necessity. We focus on three specific areas: channel transport; receptor binding and adhesion; and single-cell growth and division.},

	abstract = {Brownian motion is widely used as a model of diffusion in equilibrium media throughout the physical, chemical and biological sciences. However, many real-world systems are intrinsically out of equilibrium owing to energy-dissipating active processes underlying their mechanical and dynamical features1. The diffusion process followed by a passive tracer in prototypical active media, such as suspensions of active colloids or swimming microorganisms2, differs considerably from Brownian motion, as revealed by a greatly enhanced diffusion coefficient3-10 and non-Gaussian statistics of the tracer displacements6,9,10. Although these characteristic features have been extensively observed experimentally, there is so far no comprehensive theory explaining how they emerge from the microscopic dynamics of the system. Here we develop a theoretical framework to model the hydrodynamic interactions between the tracer and the active swimmers, which shows that the tracer follows a non-Markovian coloured Poisson process that accounts for all empirical observations. The theory predicts a long-lived Lévy flight regime11 of the loopy tracer motion with a non-monotonic crossover between two different power-law exponents. The duration of this regime can be tuned by the swimmer density, suggesting that the optimal foraging strategy of swimming microorganisms might depend crucially on their density in order to exploit the Lévy flights of nutrients12. Our framework can be applied to address important theoretical questions, such as the thermodynamics of active systems13, and practical ones, such as the interaction of swimming microorganisms with nutrients and other small particles14 (for example, degraded plastic) and the design of artificial nanoscale machines15.},

Engineering simulation, which employs computational fluid dynamics, provides a convenient means of investigating airflow behaviour in isolation rooms for various ventilation arrangements. A cough model was constructed to permit the numerical simulation of virus diffusion inside an isolation room for different ventilation system configurations. An analysis of the region of droplet fallout and the dilution time of virus diffusion of coughed gas in the isolation room was also performed for each ventilation arrangement. The numerical results presented in this paper indicate that the parallel-directional airflow pattern is the most effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. Additionally, staggering the positions of the supply vents at the door end of the room relative to the exhaust vents on the wall behind the bed head provides effective infection control and containment. These results suggest that this particular ventilation arrangement enhances the safety of staff when performing medical treatments within isolation rooms.},

The crossover is described by a non-linear system which interpolates between the derivative and the standard non-linear Schrodinger equations in imaginary time. We solve this system using the inverse scattering method for mixed-time boundary conditions introduced by us to solve the WNT. We obtain the rate function which describes the large deviations of the sample-to-sample fluctuations of the cumulative distribution of the tracer position. It exhibits a crossover as the asymmetry is varied, recovering both MFT and KPZ limits. We sketch how it is consistent with extracting the asymptotics of a Fredholm determinant formula, recently derived for sticky Brownian motions. The crossover mechanism studied here should generalize to a larger class of models described by the MFT. Our results apply to study extremal diffusion beyond Einstein's theory.},

Here, we investigate the effect of these dynamic spatiotemporal heterogeneities onto diffusion-limited reactions. We describe a general mathematical framework to translate many results for ordinary homogeneous Brownian motion to heterogeneous diffusion. In particular, we derive the probability density of the first-passage time to a reaction event and show how the dynamic disorder broadens the distribution and increases the likelihood of both short and long trajectories to reactive targets. While the disorder slows down reaction kinetics on average, its dynamic character is beneficial for a faster search and realization of an individual reaction event triggered by a single molecule.},

	abstract = {Sinai's model of diffusion in one dimension with random local bias is studied by a real space renormalization group, which yields exact results at long times. The effects of an additional small uniform bias force are also studied. We obtain analytically the scaling form of the distribution of the position x(t) of a particle, the probability of it not returning to the origin, and the distributions of first passage times, in an infinite sample as well as in the presence of a boundary and in a finite but large sample. We compute the distribution of the meeting time of two particles in the same environment. We also obtain a detailed analytic description of the thermally averaged trajectories by computing quantities such as the joint distribution of the number of returns and of the number of jumps forward. These quantities obey multifractal scaling, characterized by generalized persistence exponents {\textbackslash}texttheta (g) which we compute. In the presence of a small bias, the number of returns to the origin becomes finite, characterized by a universal scaling function which we obtain. The full statistics of the distribution of successive times of return of thermally averaged trajectories is obtained, as well as detailed analytical information about correlations between directions and times of successive jumps. The two-time distribution of the positions of a particle, x(t) and x(t') with t{\textgreater}t', is also computed exactly. It is found to exhibit “aging” with several time regimes characterized by different behaviors. In the unbiased case, for t-t'{\textbackslash}simt'α with {\textbackslash}alpha{\textgreater}1, it exhibits a lnt/lnt' scaling, with a singularity at coinciding rescaled positions x(t)=x(t'). This singularity is a novel feature, and corresponds to particles that remain in a renormalized valley. For closer times {\textbackslash}alpha{\textless}1, the two-time diffusion front exhibits a quasiequilibrium regime with a ln(t-t')/lnt' behavior which we compute. The crossover to a t/t' aging form in the presence of a small bias is also obtained analytically.

The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems. Amongst these techniques, single particle tracking (SPT) has emerged as a powerful approach to study a variety of dynamic processes in life sciences. SPT provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of SPT together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of SPT trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function.

	abstract = {The dynamics of constituents and the surface response of cellular membranes-also in connection to the binding of various particles and macromolecules to the membrane-are still a matter of controversy in the membrane biophysics community, particularly with respect to crowded membranes of living biological cells. We here put into perspective recent single particle tracking experiments in the plasma membranes of living cells and supercomputing studies of lipid bilayer model membranes with and without protein crowding. Special emphasis is put on the observation of anomalous, non-Brownian diffusion of both lipid molecules and proteins embedded in the lipid bilayer. While single component, pure lipid bilayers in simulations exhibit only transient anomalous diffusion of lipid molecules on nanosecond time scales, the persistence of anomalous diffusion becomes significantly longer ranged on the addition of disorder-through the addition of cholesterol or proteins-and on passing of the membrane lipids to the gel phase. Concurrently, experiments demonstrate the anomalous diffusion of membrane embedded proteins up to macroscopic time scales in the minute time range. Particular emphasis will be put on the physical character of the anomalous diffusion, in particular, the occurrence of ageing observed in the experiments-the effective diffusivity of the measured particles is a decreasing function of time. Moreover, we present results for the time dependent local scaling exponent of the mean squared displacement of the monitored particles. Recent results finding deviations from the commonly assumed Gaussian diffusion patterns in protein crowded membranes are reported. The properties of the displacement autocorrelation function of the lipid molecules are discussed in the light of their appropriate physical anomalous diffusion models, both for non-crowded and crowded membranes. In the last part of this review we address the upcoming field of membrane distortion by elongated membrane-binding particles. We discuss how membrane compartmentalisation and the particle-membrane binding energy may impact the dynamics and response of lipid membranes.

	abstract = {Diffusion plays a crucial role in brain function. The spaces between cells can be likened to the water phase of a foam and many substances move within this complicated region. Diffusion in this interstitial space can be accurately modelled with appropriate modifications of classical equations and quantified from measurements based on novel micro-techniques. Besides delivering glucose and oxygen from the vascular system to brain cells, diffusion also moves informational substances between cells, a process known as volume transmission. Deviations from expected results reveal how local uptake, degradation or bulk flow may modify the transport of molecules. Diffusion is also essential to many therapies that deliver drugs to the brain. The diffusion-generated concentration distributions of well-chosen molecules also reveal the structure of brain tissue. This structure is represented by the volume fraction (void space) and the tortuosity (hindrance to diffusion imposed by local boundaries or local viscosity). Analysis of these parameters also reveals how the local geometry of the brain changes with time or under pathological conditions. Theoretical and experimental approaches borrow from classical diffusion theory and from porous media concepts. Earlier studies were based on radiotracers but the recent methods use a point-source paradigm coupled with micro-sensors or optical imaging of macromolecules labelled with fluorescent tags. These concepts and methods are likely to be applicable elsewhere to measure diffusion properties in very small volumes of highly structured but delicate material.},

	abstract = {A calculation is made of the rate of diffusion of "tagged" molecules in a pure gas at uniform pressure in a long capillary tube of half-length L and radius a. At pressures for which the mean free path łambda{\textbackslash}gga, the result in the limit L→ınfty reduces to that already obtained by M. Knudsen, the diffusion coefficient D being given by 2a¯ v3, where ¯ v is the mean molecular speed. For a capillary of finite length the diffusion coefficient is, to first order in aL, smaller than this by a factor 1-3a4L. In the opposite limit of high pressures, for which łambdałla, the result reduces to the elementary kinetic theory expression for the self diffusion coefficient, D=λ¯ v3. One of the most significant features of the result is that in a long tube the diffusion coefficient drops very rapidly with increasing pressure from its initial value for łambda{\textbackslash}ggL. Thus the initial slope of D as a function of pressure is given by dDd(aλ){\textbackslash}cong-12¯ va lnLa. It is shown that these results account for the anomalous low pressure minima observed by several investigators who have measured the specific flow GΔp through long capillary tubes as a function of mean pressure ¯ p. The failure to observe such minima with porous media, for which effectively L{\textbackslash}approxa in each pore, is also explained by these results. The formulae obtained here represent a rigorous solution to the long capillary diffusion problem, valid at all pressures and subject only to the limitations of the mean free path type of treatment.},

	abstract = {How do we know that molecules really exist? An important clue came from Brownian movement, a concept developed in 1827 by botanist Robert Brown, who noticed that tiny objects like pollen grains shook and moved erratically when viewed under a microscope. Nearly 80 years later, in 1905, Albert Einstein explained this "Brownian motion" as the result of bombardment by molecules. Einstein offered a quantitative explanation by mathematically estimating the average distance covered by the particles over time as a result of molecular bombardment. Four years later, Jean Baptiste Perrin wrote Brownian Movement and Molecular Reality, a work that explains his painstaking measurements of the displacements of particles of a resin suspended in water-experiments that yielded average displacements in excellent accord with Einstein's theoretical prediction.The studies of Einstein and Perrin provided some of the first concrete evidence for the existence of molecules. Perrin, whose name is familiar to all who employ his methods for calculations in molecular dynamics, received the 1926 Nobel Prize in physics. In this classic paper, he introduced the concept of Avogadro's number, along with other groundbreaking work.

	abstract = {Diffusion in the extracellular space (ECS) of the brain is constrained by the volume fraction and the tortuosity and a modified diffusion equation represents the transport behavior of many molecules in the brain. Deviations from the equation reveal loss of molecules across the blood-brain barrier, through cellular uptake, binding, or other mechanisms. Early diffusion measurements used radiolabeled sucrose and other tracers. Presently, the real-time iontophoresis (RTI) method is employed for small ions and the integrative optical imaging (IOI) method for fluorescent macromolecules, including dextrans or proteins. Theoretical models and simulations of the ECS have explored the influence of ECS geometry, effects of dead-space microdomains, extracellular matrix, and interaction of macromolecules with ECS channels. Extensive experimental studies with the RTI method employing the cation tetramethylammonium (TMA) in normal brain tissue show that the volume fraction of the ECS typically is {\textbackslash}sim20\% and the tortuosity is {\textbackslash}sim1.6 (i.e., free diffusion coefficient of TMA is reduced by 2.6), although there are regional variations. These parameters change during development and aging. Diffusion properties have been characterized in several interventions, including brain stimulation, osmotic challenge, and knockout of extracellular matrix components. Measurements have also been made during ischemia, in models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and in human gliomas. Overall, these studies improve our conception of ECS structure and the roles of glia and extracellular matrix in modulating the ECS microenvironment. Knowledge of ECS diffusion properties is valuable in contexts ranging from understanding extrasynaptic volume transmission to the development of paradigms for drug delivery to the brain.},

	abstract = {This work is a self-contained introduction to some basic aspects of the dynamics that occurs in biological populations. It focusses on the proportion (or frequency) of a population that carries a particular gene. We make use of the notion of a force, in the context of genetics and evolution, to describe the dynamics of the frequency in an effectively infinite population. We then show how randomness enters into the dynamics of populations with a finite size, a randomness known as random genetic drift. We derive an equation, involving random numbers, which describes how the frequency behaves in a population of finite size. It is shown that in some situations this equation exhibits irreversible absorption phenomena. These phenomena are associated with the extinction (or loss) of the gene, or the complete takeover by the gene (termed fixation), where 100\% of the population carries the gene. Taking the theory further, we show how an approximation leads to a stochastic differential equation for the frequency, where random genetic drift takes the form of an additional contribution to the force, that randomly fluctuates. The stochastic differential equation is, in turn, related to a diffusion equation, which encompasses many fundamental phenomena. Because of this, the diffusion equation plausibly has a similar status in biology to the Schrödinger equation in physics. It is notable that both the Schrödinger equation and the diffusion equation have a somewhat similar mathematical structure: they both involve first order derivatives of time and second order derivatives of space (or the analogue of space). There are, however, some significant mathematical differences. In contrast to the Schrödinger equation, the diffusion equation can routinely have solutions which are singular, in that the solutions contain Dirac delta functions. The delta functions are not, however, problematic, and have an explicit biological significance. We illustrate results with some basic calculations and computer simulations.},

This confirms heuristic arguments given in [2]. These exact results include the discrete model known as the Beta random walk in a time dependent random environment, and a continuum diffusion.
