Gratitude for my husband, Ben, for being my support through every step. For my little research assistant Eleanor, who joined me in 2021. She makes it all worth it. 

For my family, especially my dad, because I wouldn't have chosen to pursue science without his encouragement. For friends who supported me from close by and far.

Thanks to everyone who watched Ellie so I could fit in another hour or two of work. For Heather, Sky, and the other incredible teachers and staff at the Co-op Family Center who loved my child and helped her grow.

Heartfelt appreciation for everyone who got me coffee/a treat or told me about the free food in such-and-such building. For my labmates: Jacob Hass, Eddie Bautista, Viola Bolton-Lum, and Franscesca Ark (who holds the record for gifted treats, I am forever indebted). For my advisor Eric Corwin, committee chair Raghuveer Parthasarathy (and the laser I stole from his lab), various physics faculty who lent a listening ear and voices of support, and Markus Allgaier for helping me far more than some random postdoc in another lab ever should have.
