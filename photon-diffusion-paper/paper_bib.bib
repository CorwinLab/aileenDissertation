	abstract = {First-passage properties underlie a wide range of stochastic processes, such as diffusion-limited growth, neuron firing and the triggering of stock options. This book provides a unified presentation of first-passage processes, which highlights its interrelations with electrostatics and the resulting powerful consequences. The author begins with a presentation of fundamental theory including the connection between the occupation and first-passage probabilities of a random walk, and the connection to electrostatics and current flows in resistor networks. The consequences of this theory are then developed for simple, illustrative geometries including the finite and semi-infinite intervals, fractal networks, spherical geometries and the wedge. Various applications are presented including neuron dynamics, self-organized criticality, diffusion-limited aggregation, the dynamics of spin systems and the kinetics of diffusion-controlled reactions. First-passage processes provide an appealing way for graduate students and researchers in physics, chemistry, theoretical biology, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, operations research and finance to understand all of these systems.},

	abstract = {Odorants are detected by olfactory receptors on the sensory cilia of olfactory receptor cells (ORCs). These cylindrical cilia have a diameters of 100–200 nm, within which the components required for signal transduction by the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP system are located. The kinetics of odorant responses are determined by the lifetimes of active proteins as well as the production, diffusion, and extrusion/degradation of second messenger molecules (cAMP and Ca2+). However, there is limited information about the molecular kinetics of ORC responses, mostly because of the technical limitations involved in studying such narrow spaces and fine structures. In this study, using a combination of electrophysiology, photolysis of caged substances, and spot UV laser stimulation, we show that second messenger molecules work only in the vicinity of their site of generation in the olfactory cilia. Such limited spreading clearly explains a unique feature of ORCs, namely, the integer multiple of unitary events that they display in low Ca2+ conditions. Although the small ORC uses cAMP and Ca2+ for various functions in different regions of the cell, these substances seem to operate only in the compartment that has been activated by the appropriate stimulus. We also show that these substances remain in the same vicinity for a long time. This enables the ORC to amplify the odorant signal and extend the lifetime of Ca2+-dependent adaptation. Cytoplasmic buffers and extrusion/degradation systems seem to play a crucial role in limiting molecular spreading. In addition, binding sites on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane may limit molecular diffusion in such a narrow space because of the high surface/volume ratio. Such efficient energy conversion may also be broadly used in other biological systems that have not yet been subjected to systematic experiments.},

	abstract = {Particles confined to a single file, in a narrow quasi-one-dimensional channel, exhibit a dynamic crossover from single file diffusion to Fickian diffusion as the channel radius increases and the particles begin to pass each other. The long time diffusion coefficient for a system in the crossover regime can be described in terms of a hopping time, which measures the time it takes for a particle to escape the cage formed by its neighbours. In this paper, we develop a transition state theory approach to the calculation of the hopping time, using the small system isobaric–isothermal ensemble to rigorously account for the volume fluctuations associated with the size of the cage. We also describe a Monte Carlo simulation scheme that can be used to calculate the free energy barrier for particle hopping. The theory and simulation method correctly predict the hopping times for a two-dimensional confined ideal gas system and a system of confined hard discs over a range of channel radii, but the method breaks down for wide channels in the hard discs’ case, underestimating the height of the hopping barrier due to the neglect of interactions between the small system and its surroundings.},

	abstract = {A calculation is made of the rate of diffusion of "tagged" molecules in a pure gas at uniform pressure in a long capillary tube of half-length L and radius a. At pressures for which the mean free path λ≫a, the result in the limit L→∞ reduces to that already obtained by M. Knudsen, the diffusion coefficient D being given by 2a¯v3, where ¯v is the mean molecular speed. For a capillary of finite length the diffusion coefficient is, to first order in aL, smaller than this by a factor 1−3a4L. In the opposite limit of high pressures, for which λ≪a, the result reduces to the elementary kinetic theory expression for the self diffusion coefficient, D=λ¯v3. One of the most significant features of the result is that in a long tube the diffusion coefficient drops very rapidly with increasing pressure from its initial value for λ≫L. Thus the initial slope of D as a function of pressure is given by dDd(aλ)≅−12¯va lnLa. It is shown that these results account for the anomalous low pressure minima observed by several investigators who have measured the specific flow GΔp through long capillary tubes as a function of mean pressure ¯p. The failure to observe such minima with porous media, for which effectively L≈a in each pore, is also explained by these results. The formulae obtained here represent a rigorous solution to the long capillary diffusion problem, valid at all pressures and subject only to the limitations of the mean free path type of treatment.},

It is shown that the ratio of the molar diffusion rate of the lighter gas to that of the heavier gas must be equal to the square root of the ratio of the molecular weight of the heavier to the lighter. From simple momentum transfer considerations a diffusion equation is derived to describe the diffusion rate as the nature of the process changes from ordinary mutual diffusion to Knudsen diffusion. This equation is shown to give good agreement with experimental measurements of diffusion rates in porous solids. A structural parameter of the porous solid, the diffusion ratio, is calculated from the experimental results and compared with the experimental value of the same ratio found from electrical resistance ratios and from flow measurements.},

The present approach provides an essentially axiom-deduction development of the theory of radiative transfer (albeit via several ill-evaluated approximations) within the context of which various processes and their interrelationships may be investigated. Most of these processes have hitherto been studied only phenomenologically and usually piecemeal. Specific application to photon scattering, cyclotron radiation, recombination radiation, de-excitation radiation, and bremsstrahlung is made in the test. The derivation of an H-theorem for photon-particle systems is sketched; and contact is made with the usual statistical mechanical treatment of the equilibrium states of such systems.

The model studied here represents a typical reaction setting encountered in diverse molecular biology systems, in which, e.g. a signal transduction proceeds via a series of consecutive ‘messengers’: the first messenger has to find its respective immobile target site triggering a launch of the second messenger, the second messenger seeks its own target site and provokes a launch of the third messenger and so on, resembling a relay race in human competitions. For such a molecular relay race taking place in infinite one-, two- and three-dimensional systems, we find exact expressions for the probability density function of the time instant of the terminal reaction event, conditioned on preceding successful reaction events on an ordered array of target sites. The obtained expressions pertain to the most general conditions: number of intermediate stages and the corresponding diffusion coefficients, the sizes of the target sites, the distances between them, as well as their reactivities are arbitrary.},

We find that the image-charge configurations of the partial-current and extrapolated-boundary conditions have the same dipole and quadrupole moments and that the two corresponding solutions to the diffusion equation are approximately equal. In the application of diffusion theory to frequency-domain photon-migration (FDPM) data, these two approaches yield values for the scattering and absorption coefficients that are equal to within 3\%. Moreover, the two boundary conditions can be combined to yield a remarkably simple, accurate, and computationally fast method for extracting values for optical parameters from FDPM data. FDPM data were taken both at the surface and deep inside tissue phantoms, and the difference in data between the two geometries is striking. If one analyzes the surface data without accounting for the boundary, values deduced for the optical coefficients are in error by 50\% or more. As expected, when aluminum foil was placed on the surface of a tissue phantom, phase and modulation data were closer to the results for an infinite-medium geometry. Raising the reflectivity of a tissue surface can, in principle, eliminate the effect of the boundary. However, we find that phase and modulation data are highly sensitive to the reflectivity in the range of 80-100\%, and a minimum value of 98\% is needed to mimic an infinite-medium geometry reliably. We conclude that noninvasive measurements of optically thick tissue require a rigorous treatment of the tissue boundary, and we suggest a unified partial-current--extrapolated boundary approach.},

The overwhelming majority of FPT studies have analyzed the time it takes a single searcher to find a target. However, the more relevant timescale in many biological systems is the time it takes the fastest searcher(s) out of many searchers to find a target, which is called an extreme FPT. In this paper, we apply extreme value theory to find a tractable approximation for the full probability distribution of extreme FPTs of diffusion. This approximation can be easily applied in many diverse scenarios, as it depends on only a few properties of the short time behavior of the survival probability of a single FPT. We find this distribution by proving that a careful rescaling of extreme FPTs converges in distribution as the number of searchers grows. This limiting distribution is a type of Gumbel distribution and involves the LambertW function. This analysis yields new explicit formulas for approximations of statistics of extreme FPTs (mean, variance, moments, etc.) which are highly accurate and are accompanied by rigorous error estimates.},

It was found essential for light scattering work to centrifuge the original Ludox solution in order to remove the aggregated material. After this treatment each Ludox sample regardless of age could be used successfully for calibration purposes. The apparent particle sizes in aqueous solutions of Ludox were smaller than those in 0.05 M NaCl solutions, the latter being in very good agreement with electron microscopic values. The refractive index increments of Ludox in water and 0.05 M NaCl were determined at three wavelengths. The influence of cell length and blackening of the cells in transmission measurements were also studied. Dissymmetries and depolarizations were small. All results indicated that particles of Ludox behave practically asRayleigh scatterers. The usefulness of these results for the calibration of light scattering photometers is discussed.},

These results are compared with results from time-independent and time-dependent diffusion equations, respectively, where the effects due to internal reflection are incorporated into an average extrapolation length in the boundary conditions. For the static properties, we find an abrupt transition from ballistic to diffusive behavior when sample thickness is about three mean free paths, i.e., L≈3l. The diffusion approximation is valid when L{\textgreater}3l, independent of the amount of internal reflection. For the dynamic properties, both the peak arrival time at short times and the diffusion constant at long times of the transmitted pulse indicate that there is a region of anomalous diffusion when 3l{\textless}L{\textless}Lc. The diffusion constant in this region increases with decreasing L. It also increases with the amount of internal reflection. The physical origin of the existence of such an anomalous region is the resonance-induced wave focusing effect. Due to the presence of internal reflection, the wave energy tends to concentrate in the forward direction at output boundary. It makes direction randomization difficult in the scattered waves. A similar wave focusing effect has been found in resonant tunneling systems of electrons in the presence of elastic scattering. The diffusion approximation is valid when L{\textgreater}Lc. The value of Lc is about ten times the average extrapolation length, i.e., L≈10ze, where ze is a fast increasing function of the amount of internal reflection.},

When the angular spread becomes comparable to the order of unit steradian, there is as much backscattering as forward scattering and diffusion phenomena take place. We start with the integral and differential equations for the two-frequency mutual coherence function under the first-order smoothing approximation, and a general diffusion equation and boundary conditions are obtained.

While the overwhelming majority of studies have focused on the time it takes a given single Brownian searcher to reach a target, cellular processes are instead often triggered by the arrival of the first molecule out of many molecules. In these scenarios, the more relevant timescale is the FPT of the first Brownian searcher to reach a target from a large group of independent and identical Brownian searchers. Though the searchers are identically distributed, one searcher will reach the target before the others and will thus have the fastest FPT. This fastest FPT depends on extremely rare events and its mean can be orders of magnitude faster than the mean FPT of a given single searcher. In this paper, we use rigorous probabilistic methods to study this fastest FPT. We determine the asymptotic behavior of all the moments of this fastest FPT in the limit of many searchers in a general class of two- and three-dimensional domains. We establish these results by proving that the fastest searcher takes an almost direct path to the target.},

General estimates and asymptotics are compared to several explicit solutions for simple domains and to numerical simulations.

Here we push the understanding of first passage processes one step further. For a simple heterogeneous system we derive rigorously the complete distribution of first passage times (FPTs). Our results demonstrate that the typical FPT significantly differs from the MFPT, which corresponds to the long time behaviour of the FPT distribution. Conversely, the short time behaviour is shown to correspond to trajectories connecting directly from the initial value to the target. Remarkably, we reveal a previously overlooked third characteristic time scale of the first passage dynamics mirroring brief excursion away from the target.},

	abstract = {Many physical, chemical, and biological systems depend on the first passage time (FPT) of a diffusive searcher to a target. Typically, this FPT is much slower than the characteristic diffusion timescale. For example, this is the case if the target is small (the narrow escape problem) or if the searcher must escape a potential well. However, many systems depend on the first time a searcher finds the target out of a large group of searchers, which is the so-called extreme FPT. Since this extreme FPT vanishes in the limit of many searchers, the prohibitively slow FPTs of diffusive search can be negated by deploying enough searchers. However, the notion of ‘enough searchers’ is poorly understood. How can one determine if a system is in the slow regime (dominated by small targets or a deep potential, for example) or the fast regime (dominated by many searchers)? How can one estimate the extreme FPT in these different regimes? In this paper, we answer these questions by deriving conditions which ensure that a system is in either regime and finding approximations of the full distribution and all the moments of the extreme FPT in these regimes. Our analysis reveals the critical effect that initial searcher distribution and target reactivity can have on extreme FPTs.},

	abstract = {A variety of systems in physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology are modeled in terms of diffusing ‘searchers’ looking for ‘targets’. Examples range from gene regulation, to cell sensing, to human decision-making. A commonly studied statistic in these models is the so-called hitting probability for each target, which is the probability that a given single searcher finds that particular target. However, the decisive event in many systems is not the arrival of a given single searcher to a target, but rather the arrival of the fastest searcher to a target out of many searchers. In this paper, we study the probability that the fastest diffusive searcher hits a given target in the many searcher limit, which we call the extreme hitting probability. We first prove an upper bound for the decay of the probability that the searcher finds a target other than the closest target. This upper bound applies in very general settings and depends only on the relative distances to the targets. Furthermore, we find the exact asymptotics of the extreme hitting probabilities in terms of the short-time distribution of when a single searcher hits a target. These results show that the fastest searcher always hits the closest target in the many searcher limit. While this fact is intuitive in light of recent results on the time it takes the fastest searcher to find a target, our results give rigorous, quantitative estimates for the extreme hitting probabilities. We illustrate our results in several examples and numerical solutions.},

	abstract = {Biological events are often initiated when a random “searcher” finds a “target,” which is called a first passage time (FPT). In some biological systems involving multiple searchers, an important timescale is the time it takes the slowest searcher(s) to find a target. For example, of the hundreds of thousands of primordial follicles in a woman’s ovarian reserve, it is the slowest to leave that trigger the onset of menopause. Such slowest FPTs may also contribute to the reliability of cell signaling pathways and influence the ability of a cell to locate an external stimulus. In this paper, we use extreme value theory and asymptotic analysis to obtain rigorous approximations to the full probability distribution and moments of slowest FPTs. Though the results are proven in the limit of many searchers, numerical simulations reveal that the approximations are accurate for any number of searchers in typical scenarios of interest. We apply these general mathematical results to models of ovarian aging and menopause timing, which reveals the role of slowest FPTs for understanding redundancy in biological systems. We also apply the theory to several popular models of stochastic search, including search by diffusive, subdiffusive, and mortal searchers.},

Our results are a special case of the theory of order statistics. We show that in one dimension the mean time to absorption at a boundary for the first ofk diffusing particles, μ1,k, goes as (lnk)−1 for the set of initial conditions in which none of thek particles is located at a boundary and goes ask−2 for the set of initial conditions in which some of thek particles may be located at the boundary. We demonstrate that in one dimension our asymptotic results (k21) are independent of the potential field in which the diffusion takes place for a wide class of potentials. We conjecture that our results are independent of dimension and produce some evidence supporting this conjecture. We conclude with a discussion of the possible import of these results on diffusion-controlled rate processes.},

Here, we propose a method for determining the depth, scattering and absorption length based upon diffuse propagation of short optical pulses. Our model allows us to extract several characteristics of the glacier. Performing Monte Carlo simulations implementing Mie scattering and mixed boundary conditions, we show that the proposed approach should be feasible with current technology. The results suggest that the optical properties and geometry of the glacier can be extracted from realistic measurements, which could be implemented with a low cost and small footprint.},

A crucial step is to model photon transport as a diffusion process. This approach is acceptable for optically thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering; however, it becomes increasingly inaccurate for thinner samples for several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling photon propagation by a telegrapher equation with suitable boundary conditions, we can account for the ballistic transport of photons at finite speed between successive scattering events. By introducing a discontinuity in the photon concentration at the source point, and then averaging over a range of penetration depths, we can account for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the forward direction, rather than being completely randomized at each event. The accuracy of our approach is tested by comparison both with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially designed suspensions of polystyrene spheres. We find that our predictions extend the utility of diffuse transmission to slabs of all thicknesses and of DWS to slabs down to about two transport mean free paths.},

However, it neglects the ballistic nature of photon propagation between successive scattering events and hence entirely breaks down for short times and distances, as well as for strong absorption. Here we generalize on the exact two-stream theory of one-dimensional photon migration to obtain a telegrapher equation that accounts for both diffusive and ballistic aspects of propagation in three-dimensional media. At long times and distances the standard diffusion theory is recovered, whereas at short times and distances we find improved predictions for such phenomena as pulse spreading, diffuse photon-density wave dispersion, transmission through a slab, and pulse reflection from a semi-infinite medium. Our theory should be useful for accurately characterizing turbid media, such as biological tissues, and may also aid in improving the spatial resolution of images made with diffuse light.},

A Fabry photometer, attached to the 40-inch refractor at the Yerkes Observatory, was used to measure the brightness of regions over a wide range of galactic latitude. The intensities in the photographic region of the spectrum were calibrated by means of the Polar Sequence stars. The mean of four such runs across the Milky Way, on circles of nearly constant longitude, l = 40°, shows a maximum of brightness of 80 stars of the tenth magnitude per square degree for the diffuse extra-terrestrial radiation. The mean of three runs near l = 140° shows a maximum of 35 in the same units. It is shown that the observed intensity of diffuse light may be explained as scattered stellar radiation if the phase function governing the scattering of starlight by the interstellar matter is strongly forward-throwing. The concentration of the diffuse light toward the galactic circle is also in agreement with this property of the phase function. The observations also indicate that the scattering efficiency, or albedo, of the particles is greater than 0.3},

	abstract = {A simple analytical method is presented that shows some potential for application to the problem of extracting attenuation and backscatter coefficients in an inhomogeneous atmosphere from the return signal of a monostatic single-wavelength lidar system. The method assumes the validity of the single-scattering lidar equation and a power law relationship between backscatter and attenuation. For optical depths greater than unity the inversion method can be applied in principle using only information contained in the signal itself. In contrast to a well-known related analytical inversion solution, the new solution form is shown to be stable with respect to perturbations in the signal, the postulated relationship between backscatter and attenuation, and the assumed or estimated boundary value of attenuation.},

When the angular spread becomes comparable to the order of unit steradian, there is as much backscattering as forward scattering and diffusion phenomena take place. We start with the integral and differential equations for the two-frequency mutual coherence function under the first-order smoothing approximation, and a general diffusion equation and boundary conditions are obtained. As examples, we present solutions for diffusion of a pulse from a point source and a plane wave incident on a slab of scatterers.},

To begin with, half move in each direction. Thereafter, and at the end of each successive interval of time τ, each particle starts a new partial path; it still moves with speed υ, and there is a probability p that it will continue to move in the same direction as in its previous path, and a probability q (= 1−p) that the direction of its velocity will be reversed, so the directions in any two consecutive intervals are correlated with a correlation coefficient c=p−q. The partial correlations for non-consecutive intervals are zero. The difference equation is found for the fraction γ(n,ν) of the number of particles at a distance y=νυτ from the origin after a time t=nτ; it is shown how γ(n,ν) may be computed; asymptotic formulae for large n are found, both for a fixed value p/q and for a fixed value of nq/p. The limiting density distribution (and the limiting characteristic function) are found when n→∞, τ→0, with nτ=t, νυτ=y, and in the limiting operation c=1−τ/A, with A constant, so that c→1, and the speed υ is kept constant; the limiting form of the difference equation is the telegraph equation, with υ2=(LC)−1, A=L/R, where L, C, and R are the self-inductance, capacitance, and resistance per unit length; and the limiting density distribution is the solution of this equation for an instantaneous source. If p+q≠1, and there is, at the end of each interval of time τ, a non-zero probability, 1−p−q, that a particle will escape from the system, then the same limiting operation, with T/(1−p−q)=G, G constant, leads to the telegraph equation with leakage, the leakage resistance being G/C. The solution of the telegraph equation is further considered (and in particular is given in terms of Lommel's function of two variables) when one end of a long cable is held at a constant potential for t≥0.},

	abstract = {A particle entering a scattering and absorbing medium executes a random walk through a sequence of scattering events. The particle ultimately either achieves first-passage, leaving the medium, or it is absorbed. The Kubelka–Munk model describes a flux of such particles moving perpendicular to the surface of a plane-parallel medium with a scattering rate and an absorption rate. The particle path alternates between the positive direction into the medium and the negative direction back towards the surface. Backscattering events from the positive to the negative direction occur at local maxima or peaks, while backscattering from the negative to the positive direction occur at local minima or valleys. The probability of a particle avoiding absorption as it follows its path decreases exponentially with the path-length λ. The reflectance of a semi-infinite slab is therefore the Laplace transform of the distribution of path-length that ends with a first-passage out of the medium. In the case of a constant scattering rate the random walk is a Poisson process. We verify our results with two iterative calculations, one using the properties of iterated convolution with a symmetric kernel and the other via direct calculation with an exponential step-length distribution. We present a novel demonstration, based on fluctuation theory of sums of random variables, that the first-passage probability as a function of the number of peaks n in the alternating path is a step-length distribution-free combinatoric expression involving Catalan numbers. Counting paths with backscattering on the real half-line results in the same Catalan number coefficients as Dyck paths on the whole numbers. Including a separate forward-scattering Poisson process results in a combinatoric expression related to counting Motzkin paths. We therefore connect walks on the real line to discrete path combinatorics.},

Among the different factors that can influence the measurement result, the effect of laser power has so far not been studied thoroughly. Methods: The sensitivity of a DLS instrument was first considered on a theoretical level, followed by experiments using DLS instruments, equipped with two different lasers of (nominal) 45 mW, and 100 mW, respectively. This work analyzes dilute colloidal dispersions of lysozyme as model protein. Results: Theoretical findings agreed with experiments in that only enhanced laser power of 100 mW laser allowed measuring a 0.1 mg/mL protein dispersion in a reliable manner. Results confirmed the usefulness of the presented theoretical considerations in improving a general understanding of the limiting factors in DLS. Conclusions: Laser power is a critical aspect regarding adequate colloidal analysis by DLS. Practical guidance is provided to help scientists specifically with measuring dilute samples to choose both an optimal instrument configuration as well as a robust experimental procedure.},

Gold nanospheres were used as a reference, since their luminescence has been investigated previously and their light absorption and scattering properties are described analytically by Mie theory. We then studied gold nanobipyramids and nanostars that have recently gained interest as building blocks for new plasmonic nanosensors. The aim of our study is to determine whether the luminescence of gold nanoparticles of complex shape (bipyramids and nanostars) is a plasmon-assisted process, in line with the conclusions of recent spectroscopic studies on spheres and nanorods. Our study has been performed on particles in suspension in order to avoid any artefact from the heterogeneous environment created when particles are deposited on a substrate. We employ a recently developed photon time-of-flight method in combination with correlation spectroscopy of the light scattered by the particles to probe the luminescent properties of individual particles based on a particle-by-particle spectral analysis. Furthermore, we have performed resonant light scattering spectroscopic measurements on the same samples. Our work demonstrates the power of our time-of flight method for uncovering the plasmonic signatures of individual bipyramids and nanostars during their brief passage in the focal volume of a confocal set-up. These spectral features of individual particles remain hidden in macroscopic measurements. We find that the intrinsic photoluminescence emission of gold bipyramids and gold nanostars is mediated by their localized surface plasmons.},

While this approach does not match the exact value of c as does the P 1/3 method, the latter method is an ad hoc approach that has not been justified on theoretical grounds. This article provides the theoretical justification for the almost-correct value of c that yields improved results for the well-known (one-dimensional) Su-Olson benchmark for radiative transfer, for which we obtain a semi-analytic solution in the case of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We found that the asymptotic P 1 approximation yields a better solution than the diffusion, the classic P 1, and the P 1/3 approximations, yielding the correct steady-state behavior for the energy density and the (almost) correct particle velocity.},

	abstract = {The use of laser-based optical techniques for medical imaging is an attractive alternative to other methods that utilize ionizing radiation. Beside being non-carcinogenic, it is non-invasive, the equipment is transportable, and the methodology can be used to examine properties of soft tissue. However, unlike x-ray photons, optical photons generated in the near-infrared suffer significant amounts of scattering by heterogeneous bodies (e.g., organelles) found in biological tissue. Thus, theory is required to interpret experimental data which appear in the form o spatially or temporally varying light patterns on the skin surface. There is a wide range of parameters over which either diffusion theory or the theory of lattice random walks can be called on to translate optical data into medically significant information embodied in optical parameters of the tissue. We discuss several problems in diffusion theory arising in the analysis of optical measurements, for tissues modeled by a semi-infinite or slab geometry, having either isotropic or anisotropic optical parameters. The measured quantities are related to the intensity of light re-emitted on the tissue surface. A brief discussion is given related to the telegrapher’s equation, which has been suggested as a simple way of incorporating the effects of forward scattering. Mention is made of calculations related to layered media which frequently occur in tissues such as skull and esophagus. Finally, we briefly discuss discrete random walk models for photon migration. These have recently been used to provide parameters conveying information related to the region interrogated by photons constrained to reappear on skin surface.},

	abstract = {The presence of temporal correlations in random movement trajectories is a widespread phenomenon across biological, chemical and physical systems. The ubiquity of persistent and anti-persistent motion in many natural and synthetic systems has led to a large literature on the modelling of temporally correlated movement paths. Despite the substantial body of work, little progress has been made to determine the dynamical properties of various transport related quantities, including the first-passage or first-hitting probability to one or multiple absorbing targets when space is bounded. To bridge this knowledge gap we generalise the renewal theory of first-passage and splitting probabilities to correlated discrete variables. We do so in arbitrary dimensions on a lattice for the so-called correlated or persistent random walk, the one step non-Markovian extension of the simple lattice random walk in bounded and unbounded space. We focus on bounded domains and consider both persistent and anti-persistent motion in hypercubic lattices as well as the hexagonal lattice. The discrete formalism allows us to extend the notion of the first-passage to that of the directional first-passage, whereby the walker must reach the target from a prescribed direction for a hitting event to occur. As an application to spatio-temporal observations of correlated moving cells that may be either repelled or attracted to hard surfaces, we compare the first-passage statistics to a target within a reflecting domain depending on whether an interaction with the reflective interface invokes a reversal of the movement direction or not. With strong persistence we observe multi-modality in the first-passage distribution in the former case, which instead is greatly suppressed in the latter.},

	abstract = {In many-particle diffusions, particles that move the furthest and fastest can play an outsized role in physical phenomena. A theoretical understanding of the behavior of such extreme particles is nascent. A classical model, in the spirit of Einstein's treatment of single-particle diffusion, has each particle taking independent homogeneous random walks. This, however, neglects the fact that all particles diffuse in a common and often inhomogeneous environment that can affect their motion. A more sophisticated model treats this common environment as a space-time random biasing field which influences each particle's independent motion. While the bulk (or typical particle) behavior of these two models has been found to match to high degree, recent theoretical work of G. Barraquand and I. Corwin, Probab. Theory Relat. Fields 167, 1057 (2017) and G. Barraquand and P. Le Doussal, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53, 215002 (2020) on a one-dimensional exactly solvable version of this random environment model suggests that the extreme behavior is quite different between the two models. We transform these asymptotic (in system size and time) results into physically applicable predictions. Using high-precision numerical simulations we reconcile different asymptotic phases in a manner that matches numerics down to realistic system sizes, amenable to experimental confirmation. We characterize the behavior of extreme diffusion in the random environment model by the presence of a new phase with anomalous fluctuations related to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class and equation.},

A correct diffusion coefficient for the stationary case could be obtained. However, this solution did not lead to the correct phase velocity.

In particular, we derive for the first time explicit expressions of MFPTs for emblematic models of transport in complex media, such as diffusion on deterministic and random fractals. This approach relies on a scale-invariance hypothesis and a large volume expansion of the MFPT, which actually proves to be very accurate even for small system sizes as shown by numerical simulations. This explicit determination of MFPTs can be straightforwardly generalized to further useful first-passage observables such as occupation times and splitting probabilities.},

	abstract = {The mean first passage time (MFPT) of random walks is a key quantity characterizing dynamic processes on disordered media. In a random fractal embedded in the Euclidean space, the MFPT is known to obey the power law scaling with the distance between a source and a target site with a universal exponent. We find that the scaling law for the MFPT is not determined solely by the distance between a source and a target but also by their locations. The role of a site in the first passage processes is quantified by the random walk centrality. It turns out that the site of highest random walk centrality, dubbed as a hub, intervenes in first passage processes. We show that the MFPT from a departure site to a target site is determined by a competition between direct paths and indirect paths detouring via the hub. Consequently, the MFPT displays a crossover scaling between a short distance regime, where direct paths are dominant, and a long distance regime, where indirect paths are dominant. The two regimes are characterized by power laws with different scaling exponents. The crossover scaling behavior is confirmed by extensive numerical calculations of the MFPTs on the critical percolation cluster in two dimensional square lattices.},

The conditional probability function u for the cell moving inside such domains (tissue) fulfills by assumption a diffusion–advection equation that is subject to a Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer boundary and a Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary. The mean first-passage time (MFPT) function determined by u estimates the average time for the travelling cell to reach various interesting targets. The MFPT function fulfills a Poisson equation inside a domain with suitable boundary conditions, which give rise to various mathematical problems. The main novelty of this study is the characterization of such an MFPT function inside an annulus and an annular cylinder, which is subject to a Robin boundary condition on the inner boundary and a Dirichlet boundary condition on the outer one, and these are integral functions whose densities are the solution of an inhomogeneous system of linear integral equations.},

Experimental tests of this simple model in tissue-simulating liquid phantoms of different geometries are presented here. The results of these tests show that, in a semi-infinite phantom, the application of the diffusion model provides estimates of the absorption and transport-scattering coefficients that are accurate to better than 10\%. Comparable accuracy was also obtained with this simple model for finite slab, cylindrical, and spherical volumes as long as the objects were of sufficient size. For smaller volumes the absorption coefficient was overestimated because of the significant loss of photons at the boundaries of the object.},

Time-of-flight distributions were analyzed using Haar transform with selection of the most parsimonious set of wavelets by genetic algorithm optimization. Results showed that the scattering coefficient could be estimated with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 4.4\% and r2=0.95 using wavelets of frequency up to 400MHz. Absorption coefficients were estimated with a CV of 6.9\% and r2=0.99 using steady-state intensity of blank- and scatter-corrected data. Furthermore, it was shown that quantification using simplified electronics can estimate scattering to within 7.2\% (r2=0.88) and absorption with an error of 8.3\% (r2=0.99). The above findings suggest that a simplified instrument based on a pulsed laser diode and low frequency switches could be developed to quantify absorption in highly scattering media.},

Statistical descriptors of the time-resolved photon distributions were used to obtain information inherent to absorption and scattering processes in a sample. Changes in a sample’s absorption and scattering properties and apparent particle diameter were simultaneously estimated using stepwise multi-linear regression (SMLR) and partial least squares regression (PLS). Models were constructed using time-distributions taken at both single and multiple radial displacements between source and detector. SMLR estimates of absorption and particle diameter required descriptors related to the trailing and rising edges of the time profiles, respectively. The inclusion of multi-perspective information allowed for improved estimates for all quantities. Using statistical descriptors, a robust means for simplifying complex photon time-distributions into measurable parameters was found. It was found that the SMLR model gave slightly better results compared with the PLS model. The absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient and apparent particle diameter were estimated to within 10, 9 and 7\% of their respective reference values with SMLR. In the future, this approach may be used as a means in which to develop practical instrumentation for on-line, real-time characterisation of absorbing granular media.},

	abstract = {A photon transport model for light migration in turbid media based on a cumulant approximation to radiative transfer is presented for image reconstruction inside an infinite medium or a bounded medium with a planar geometry. This model treats weak inhomogeneities through a Born approximation of the Boltzmann radiative transfer equation and uses the second-order cumulant solution of photon density to the Boltzmann equation as the Green’s function for the uniform background. It provides the correct behavior of photon migration at early times and reduces at long times to the center-moved diffusion approximation. At early times, it agrees much better with the result from the Monte Carlo simulation than the diffusion approximation. Both approximations agree well with the Monte Carlo simulation at later times. The weight function for image reconstruction under this proposed model is shown to have a strong dependence at both early and later times on absorption and/or scattering inhomogeneities located in the propagation direction of and close to the source, or in the field of view of and close to the detector. This effect originates from the initial ballistic motion of incident photons, which is substantially underestimated by the diffusion approximation.},

	abstract = {A hybrid radiative-transfer–diffusion model for optical tomography is proposed. The light propagation is modeled with the radiative-transfer equation in the vicinity of the laser sources, and the diffusion approximation is used elsewhere in the domain. The solution of the radiative-transfer equation is used to construct a Dirichlet boundary condition for the diffusion approximation on a fictitious interface within the object. This boundary condition constitutes an approximative distributed source model for the diffusion approximation in the remaining area. The results from the proposed approach are compared with finite-element solutions of the radiative-transfer equation and the diffusion approximation and Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the method improves the accuracy of the forward model compared with the conventional diffusion model.},

	abstract = {The first-passage time for a single diffusing particle has been studied extensively, but the first-passage time of a system of many diffusing particles, as is often the case in physical systems, has received little attention until recently. We consider two models for many-particle diffusion—one treats each particle as independent simple random walkers while the other treats them as coupled to a common space-time random forcing field that biases particles nearby in space and time in similar ways. The first-passage time of a single diffusing particle under both models shows the same statistics and scaling behavior. However, for many-particle diffusions, the first-passage time among all particles (the extreme first-passage time) is very different between the two models, effected in the latter case by the randomness of the common forcing field. We develop an asymptotic (in the number of particles and location where first passage is being probed) theoretical framework to separate the impact of the random environment with that of the sampling trajectories within it. We identify a power law describing the impact of the environment on the variance of the extreme first-passage time. Through numerical simulations, we verify that the predictions from this asymptotic theory hold even for systems with widely varying numbers of particles, all the way down to 100 particles. This shows that measurements of the extreme first-passage time for many-particle diffusions provide an indirect measurement of the underlying environment in which the diffusion is occurring.},

	abstract = {Background: Elucidation of the highly forward scattering of photons in random media such as biological tissue is crucial for further developments of optical imaging using photon transport models. We evaluated length and time scales of the photon scattering in three-dimensional media. Methods: We employed analytical solutions of the time-dependent radiative transfer, M-th order delta-Eddington, and photon diffusion equations (RTE, dEM, and PDE). We calculated the fluence rates at different source-detector distances and optical properties. Results: We found that the zeroth order dEM and PDE, which approximate the highly forward scattering to the isotropic scattering, are valid in longer length and time scales than approximately     10 /  μ t ′      and     40 /  μ t ′  v    , respectively, where     μ t ′     is the reduced transport coefficient and v the speed of light in a medium. The first and second order dEM, which approximate the highly forward-peaked phase function by the first two and three Legendre moments, are valid in the longer scales than approximately     4.0 /  μ t ′      and     6.3 /  μ t ′  v    ;     2.8 /  μ t ′      and     3.5 /  μ t ′  v    , respectively. The boundary conditions less influence the length scales, while they reduce the times scales from those for bulk at the longer length scale than approximately     4.0 /  μ t ′     . Conclusion: Our findings are useful for constructions of accurate and efficient photon transport models. We evaluated length and time scales of the highly forward scattering of photons in various kinds of three-dimensional random media by analytical solutions of the radiative transfer, M-th order delta-Eddington, and photon diffusion equations.},

	abstract = {In 1956 Mark Kac proposed a process related to the telegrapher equation where the particle travels at constant speed (say the speed of light c) and randomly inverts its velocity. This process had important applications concerning the path-integral solution and the probabilistic interpretation of the 1\$\$+\$\$1 dimensions Dirac equation. The extension to 3\$\$+\$\$1 dimensions requires that the particle only moves at light-speed, which implies that velocity can be represented as a point on the surface of a sphere of radius c. The realizations of the process for the velocity only may connect these points, and, by strict analogy with the Kac model, it can be assumed that the velocity jumps from one value to another. In this paper we follow a new and different strategy assuming that the velocity performs continuous trajectories (velocity changes direction in a continuous way) which are the realization of a Wiener process on the surface. The processes which emerge transform one in the other by Lorentz boost. The associate Forward Kolmogorov Equation for the joint probability density of position and velocity, which is the (3\$\$+\$\$1) dimensional analogous of the telegrapher equation, is examined and a simplification is performed by means of variables separation.},
