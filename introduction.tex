\chapter{Introduction}

The following three chapters are two papers which I composed during my time as a graduate student, and an additional chapter on unpublished work. Chapter \ref{1Drandom} (published in PRE (citation)) explores a method that I developed along with Eric Corwin and Jacob Hass. This allowed us to measure stuff. We concluded conclusions. In Chapter \ref{photons} (in review (cite)), we used whatever to test whatever. The results are resulting. In chapter \ref{extras}, we did more stuff that has not led to publication yet but I'm sure I can talk about it still.
